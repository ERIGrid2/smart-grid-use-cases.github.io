Under normal (steady-state) conditions on the grid’s side the inverter should always maximize its power injection to the grid so that better exploitation of the solar potential is achieved. The normal operation entails that other services or functionality, that the inverter could potentially provide, such as droop control of active/reactive power or intentional power curtailment, do not act during the test. The efficiency characterization of the PV inverter in this test comes down to two main aspects of operation: on the one hand, the power/energy efficiency of the power converter and, on the other hand, the capability of the Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) to detect the actual maximum power of the PV array.\nFunction(s) under Investigation (FuI)  Power conversion Maximum Power Point Tracker  Object under Investigation (OuI)  Photovoltaic Inverter  Domain under Investigation (DuI)  Electrical Environment  Purpose of Investigation (PoI)  PoI#1: Characterisation of power converter efficiency PoI#2: Characterisation of MPPT accuracy  System under Test (SuT) In this TC the System-under-Test is the PV inverter which is connected on one end to the PV array and on other to the AC distribution grid. Functions under Test (FuT)  PV conversion (Current-Voltage characteristic of the PV array) Droop controllers for Active/Reactive power adjustment when the inverter is equipped with this functionality  Test criteria (TCR)  Power/energy efficiency MPPT accuracy  Target Metrics (TM)   Ratio of output versus input power:\n  Ratio of input power versus maximum theoretical PV power:\n  Variability Attributes (VA) Fully Controllable attributes:\n Solar irradiation (varies gradually from 0 to 1200 W/m2) Ambient temperature (it can vary from –20oC to +50oC) PV array asymmetrical operation (e.g., partial shading) (varies stepwise) Grid voltage and frequency (constant, e.g., 230V/50Hz) PV modules parameters PV array configuration  Quality Attributes (QA)  Sampling time of signals (Power flows): \u0026lt;=1 s Resolution: 0.1% of maximum output (AC) power Points of measurement:  One point at the AC output of the inverter One point at the DC input of the inverter   PDC,min=5% of rated power PDC,max=110% of rated power Vmin\u0026lt;VDC\u0026lt;Vmax (the minimum and maximum voltage depends on the inverter specification provided by the manufacturer)  Qualification Strategy The two PoIs of the selected TC can be addressed through two separate Test Specifications, partly in a combined way. In particular, in order to characterise the inverter’s efficiency (PoI#1) one test procedure (TS1) is required in which the SuT is tested under a wide range of irradiance variation. During this test the irradiance varies in a way that allows for the inverter to reach stability (e.g., not during fast moving clouds). For each stable operation point the input (DC) and output (AC) power values of the inverter are recorded and used for the calculation of the efficiency. Together with the converter efficiency the evaluation of the MPPT accuracy (PoI#2) can partly be obtained. The way to do this is the following: For each measuring point the maximum available power of the PV array is either calculated or measured and used in combination with the actual DC power at the inverter input in order to assess the accuracy of the MPPT algorithm. This test presumes the balanced operation of all PV modules in the array. Such operation leads to a smooth I-V characteristic which results in a P-V (power versus voltage) characteristic with one maximum point of power. However, a very interesting case can be the unbalanced operation of the PV modules which results not only in lower power but in a P-V characteristic with several maxima as well. The cause of such behaviour could be, for instance, partial shading over the PV array. As a consequence, in order to characterise the MPPT accuracy in a more holistic manner, a separate test (TS2) is required for the investigation of the inverter operation under unbalanced conditions on the PV array side.\n","excerpt":"Test Case 5: Power efficiency characterisation of PhotoVoltaic (PV) inverters Version management …","ref":"/test-case-descriptions/docs/usecases/erigrid2.0/tc05/","title":"Test Case TC05"},{"body":"Test Case 6: Evaluation of frequency restoration response in islanded power system Version management Author E.

This way, the benefits for the prosumers are attractive, thus favouring the deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs) and the willingness of the end-users to participate in the local energy market. The operators are responsible for providing the local market platform and take care of their possible congestions while the prosumers have the full control over their DERs. This means a different perspective over the energy management problem, traditionally centred at the distribution system operators who look for certain overall performance and benefits for the full population of DERs (e.g., by providing ancillary services upstream) instead of improving the individual benefits of the participants.\nFunction(s) under Investigation (FuI)  Bidding algorithms of the individual prosumers Clearing function of the energy trading coordinator  Object under Investigation (OuI)  Modules for creating the bids at prosumer’s level Module of the energy sharing coordinator for estimating the internal price Communication modules between a set of converters/distributed energy resources and manageable loads  Domain under Investigation (DuI)  Electrical Power ICT Market Heating/Cooling  Purpose of Investigation (PoI)  PoI1: Verification of the trading energy platform functioning to get a cost-effective operation for both the energy sharing coordinator and the prosumers (economic criteria) PoI2: Validation that the control signals derived from the decision-making process are feasible to the controllable electrical devices (technical criteria)  System under Test (SuT) Local energy community (LEC), distributed energy resources (DERs), controllers, ICT components (measuring/monitoring devices), benchmark distribution system (optional).\nFunctions under Test (FuT)  Capability of communication among different OuI.

The level of voltage fluctuation depends on grid topology, different operating conditions as well as level of RES penetration. Therefore, voltage control in distribution grids has become an essential task.\nIndeed, effective voltage control strategies have a number of benefits:\n Reduce voltage fluctuation Improve quality of power supply Maximize the penetration of PV into the grid Participate in ancillary services Increase the flexibility of operation Reduce PV curtailment There are a variety of voltage control strategies for distribution grids such as centralized, decentralized, or distributed. This Test Case is proposed to evaluate the distributed voltage control for distribution grids with high integration of single- and three-phase PV systems under different operating conditions.  Function(s) under Investigation (FuI)  MAS-based distributed voltage-var control Reactive power capability of PV systems and their reactive power control modes for voltage control support  The amount of reactive power absorbed/injected by the PV systems can be controlled following the characteristic below (ENTSO EN 50438:2013 or ENTSO EN 50549-1:2019 “Requirements for micro-generating plants to be connected in parallel with public low-voltage distribution networks”):\nIn addition, the reactive power exchange capability of the PV systems must meet these requirements:\n follow a characteristic curve provided by the DSO (see 4.4) within the active factor cos ϕ = 0,90-under-excited to 0,90-over-excited when the active power output of the PV plants is more than or equal to 20 % of its nominal active power; not exchanging more reactive power than 10 % of the PV plant’s nominal active power when the active power output is less than 20 % of its nominal active power.

As a result, the distribution network operators (DSOs) need to focus on the challenge of balancing power supply and demand. Congestion in the distribution network refers to an overvoltage at the connection points as well as overloading of the network components.\nOn the one hand, to mitigate the network strains, conventionally DSOs focus mainly on network development by installing new cables and transformers to meet the increasing power flows. Nonetheless, the distribution loads are spread over large geographically areas and in a distributed manner, making the upgrade of the network more financially infeasible in a short term. Another alternative solution is to develop grid congestion management approaches so that the network infrastructure can be utilized in a better way. There are two types of congestion management methods namely direct as well as indirect. The former technique is realized by performing load curtailment, local generation reduction, network re-configuration, new installation of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). In contrast, the latter approach focuses on solving the optimization of electricity cost with the constraints ensuring the transformers/feeders not to be overloaded.\nThe direct congestion management method in this test includes two stages. The first stage consists of using a machine learning method, such as support vector machine, multi-class classification, decision tree, ANN\u0026hellip;, in order to build congestion classification models. Once congestion is detected, it has to be labeled to one of the following statuses: normal, alert, emergency, and critical depending on the output of the trained models. In the second step, DSOs will use the congestion labeling to calculate the expected flexibility portfolio. With the expected procurement cost, the flexibility available in the feeders/households can be used to solve the congestion problem. After comparing the results with different conditions, the best setting for the congestion management can be chosen.\nOn the other hand, an indirect congestion management needs to be based on an online learning technique to emulate the demand flexibility of a network. As for emulating the demand flexibility, the concept of price elasticity of demand can be considered. Accordingly, demand flexibility during all time-periods of a day shall be treated as a commodity that can be substituted or complemented to each other.\nThe objective of this Test Case is to evaluate different congestion management methods in distribution grid under the circumstance of high penetration of DERs and other active loads such as EVs, HPs \u0026hellip;\nFunction(s) under Investigation (FuI) Congestion management of the DMS controller\n Direct approach: mitigating congestions by curtailment of load and local generation and by influencing the voltage level at the secondary side of a MV/LV transformer Indirect approach: motivating individual prosumers with dynamic prices through intermediate market entities such as aggregators and retailers. DSOs also incentivize customers by providing compensations for their load reduction when needed to solve network congestions.

The transition from grid-connected to islanded mode should be made in a seamless way in order to eliminate loss of power supply on the microgrid consumer’s side (Uninterruptible Power Supply) and it is based on an automatic switch that disconnects the microgrid at the point of common coupling (PCC) as well as on at least one DER unit that has the ability to form the grid voltage once connection to the upstream grid is lost.\nFunction(s) under Investigation (FuI)  Over/under voltage detection Over/under frequency detection ROCOF detection Primary voltage control Primary frequency control  Object under Investigation (OuI)  Protection relay Static Switch DER inverters  Domain under Investigation (DuI)  Electrical ICT (time-delays) Electrochemical Thermal Environmental  Purpose of Investigation (PoI)  Validation of Uninterruptible Power Supply capability  System under Test (SuT) The main components and subsystems that are of interest for this TC are depicted in the above diagram and summarized below:\n Protection Relay Static Switch CHP microturbines Battery inverters Communication channels   Functions under Test (FuT)  Microgrid Frequency Controller (MFC) Battery Management System MPPT Load control SCADA Energy Management System  Test criteria (TCR)  Frequency response Voltage response  Target Metrics (TM)  Maximum Voltage deviations Maximum frequency deviations Maximum ROCOF Response/stabilization time  Variability Attributes (VA) Fully Controllable attributes:\n Protection relay parameters Droop control parameters Inverter control functionalities  Partly Controllable attributes:\n Load active/reactive power Generator active/reactive power  Uncontrollable attributes:\n Solar irradiation Wind speed Ambient temperature ICT and control delays  Quality Attributes (QA)  Sampling time of signals (frequency, voltages): \u0026lt;1ms Resolution:  frequency 0.05Hz, voltage 0.005 pu   Points of measurement:  Frequency: at least 1 (at the point of common coupling) Voltage: 1 point for each resource connected at their electrical output    Qualification Strategy In order to meet the specific PoI, which is the evaluation of the microgrid’s capability of UPS, three test specifications are required: -One test is related to the protection equipment and its effective detection of disturbances in the upstream distribution grid. This test ensures that the combination of the protection relay and the static switch can adequately disconnect the microgrid when frequency disturbances appear. This test examines the response of the protection subsystem for various kinds of disturbances including over/underfrequency and increased ROCOF. -The second test is related to the protection subsystem and its ability to detect voltage disturbances. The reason why this functionality is addressed separately than the frequency test is the different requirements in the test system topology. In the voltage test, specifically, the detailed microgrid topology is considered since it can affect the voltage level at the Point of Common Coupling. -The third test is related to the response of the grid-supporting voltage source inverters of the microgrid after the disconnection. In principle, the test aims to assess the capability of these resources to maintain a voltage/frequency deviation within specific limits thanks to the primary control. The test is conducted under different initial conditions depending on the event that activates the protection equipment (for example, over/underfrequency).\n","excerpt":"Test Case 10: Evaluation of secure transition from grid-connected to islanded operation: …","ref":"/test-case-descriptions/docs/usecases/erigrid2.0/tc10/","title":"Test Case TC10"},{"body":"Test Case TC11: Characterization of power-to-heat service availability and its impact on the networks Version management Author Tue Jensen, Kai Heussen (Edmund Widl)\nVersion 0.2\nProject SmILES, ERIGrid 2.0\nDate 2020-12-16\nNarrative A network-integrated booster heat pump is used to also provide services to the electrical system.

As a result, advanced control strategies to manage such networks are becoming necessary.\nAn optimal centralized Coordinated Voltage Control (CVC) operates as a distribution management system. The algorithm manages all the devices of the network that are capable of regulating the voltage either directly (OLTCs), or through the injection of active/reactive power, such as Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and Photovoltaic (PV) inverters. Management is based on the solution of an optimization problem, which minimizes a predefined objective function, subject to linear and non-linear constraints.\nA central controller is installed at substation level and is initialized with all the necessary static data of the network: network topology, admittance of lines and transformer, nominal power of DER units and storage systems, operating limits, tap change operations of the OLTC, etc. While it operates, it requests and receives real-time power measurements from the smart meters of loads and DER units, as well as the state of charge (SoC) of the storage systems and the current tap position of the OLTC. Using this dynamic data, it formulates the optimal power flow problem, whose objective function involves the minimization of voltage deviation of critical nodes from the nominal value, power losses of the lines and transformer, and tap change operations of the OLTC.\nFunction(s) under Investigation (FuI) PV inverter’s Q(U) control, OLTC controlling secondary voltage, MGCC behavior\nObject under Investigation (OuI) MicroGrid Central Controller (MGCC)\nDomain under Investigation (DuI) Electrical Power, ICT\nPurpose of Investigation (PoI)  Characterization and validation of the SuT Verification and validation of the OuI Verification and validation of the FuT  System under Test (SuT) PV, OLTC, transformer, distribution line, upstream network impedance, MGCC\nFunctions under Test (FuT) Optimal centralized coordinated voltage control algorithm, Communication scheme\nTest criteria (TCR)  OLTC behaviour according to reactive power levels Inverter’s effectiveness in participation in voltage regulation Inverter’s reaction to tap changes BESS management effectiveness Industrial MGCC behavior  Target Metrics (TM)  When and how often the optimization converges.

The test validates the correctness of the disconnection order of components, as well as the ability of the controller to reconnect them at times when voltage and frequency are well within specific boundaries and more or less stable. -The second test verifies the ability of the system to maintain voltage and frequency within specific boundaries after the BS generator is started up by the BS central controller. The specific operating limits for this test are more relaxed as opposed to the ones that apply in normal operation. -The third test is a sort of endurance test which validates the BS generator’s ability to provide the service for a minimum time duration (e.g., 1 hour).

The characterization of this performance is one of the major goals of this test case, taking into account the different communication technologies that could be supported in such devices (e.g. communication protocols) and the stochastic nature of communication effects. In particular, the experiments in the test case allow characterizing the performance of communication equipment by means of communication delay calculation and the rate of dropped packets between two RTUs. Through this experiment, it is possible to determine the mean value and the standard deviation of the communication delay between two devices, together with the packet loss rate for different polling times.\nFunction(s) under Investigation (FuI) The characteristics of two communication devices exchanging information.

One communication emulator, such as ATTERO Ethernet connection cables (RJ45)  Test criteria (TCR)  The real time simulator needs to send a data profile periodically using a certain pre-defined communication protocol. Due to the stochastic nature of communication phenomena, the data profile needs to be sent periodically enough times to be able to obtain statistically valid results.

Target Metrics (TM) Data profile:\n The data profile needs to be arranged in a way that it is possible to determine the communication roundtrip time (delay) of each data value. A series of increasing integer values is proposed with an increasing value change periodicity. For example:  In the previous figure, the constant α represents the reduction of the time during a particular value is sent. It is noted that the polling time of the devices must be less than the time duration of a sent value.\n  The delay and the lost packages have to be registered:\n  The delay for each successfully transmitted data value can be used to create a normal distribution of the delay probability (obtaining the mean delay value and its standard deviation):\n  The successful transmission rate can be calculated for each value sent from the profile, allowing to determine the minimum periodicity that can be 100% successfully transmitted\n  Variability Attributes (VA)  Periodicity for which a data value changes.

More specifically, the focus is on cyber resilience of digital substations. In a digital substation, analogue signal wiring is replaced with digital Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) links. Communication within a digital substation is realized through the IEC 61850 standard that covers substation automation and protection functionalities. Communication with the control center is realized through a dedicated communication gateway using protocols such as IEC 60870-5-104 and/or DNP 3.

Specifically, characterize and verify the impact of ICT infrastructure performance on grid operations, in a digital substation in the presence of:\n Component failures in the ICT infrastructure of the substation Misconfiguration of the ICT infrastructure Cyber attacks targeting the substation ICT infrastructure The impact on grid operations is measured by noting how aforementioned factors affect protection functionality, i.e., tripping times in a digital substation.  System under Test (SuT) A digital substation includes substation bays, merging units, Ethernet switches (representing the process bus), Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs), time servers, Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), centralized protection and control units, station control systems, etc. A substation bay comprises busbars, disconnectors, circuit breakers, current and voltage transformers (CTs and VTs), etc. Hence, to realize this test case, the following components are required:\n Real-time grid simulator such as RTDS or OPAL-RT that supports Hardware-in-Loop (HIL) studies Substation network elements:  At least one ethernet switch and time server.

This can be achieved by determining how protection functionality and thereby power system stability is affected by disturbances to ICT infrastructure.\n As per the IEC 61850 standard, the maximum tripping time for protection equipment should always be lesser than 10ms. Hence, this can be used as a metric to assess the cyber resilience of a digital substation. This assessment is subject to presence of component failures in the ICT infrastructure of the substation, misconfigurations, and cyber attacks targeting the substation ICT infrastructure.

Rajkumar, Jawad Kazmi\nVersion Project ERIGrid 2.0\nDate 19/4/2021\nNarrative Smart grid interoperability is a main enabling facet of electricity technology developments. It comprises all parts of the smart grid, from generation to transmission and from distribution to consumption. Testing interoperability requires producing detailed test cases describing how smart grid components are intended to interact with each other. A systematic approach for developing smart grid interoperability tests may facilitate the dissemination of innovative solutions, the stability and resilience of the smart grid.\nThe proposed Test Case is conducted following the JRC Smart Grid Interoperability methodology. The methodology is used mainly as a common framework for interoperability testing and consist of five stages; Use Case creation (UC), Basic Application Profile (BAP) creation, Basic Application Interoperability profile (BAIOP) creation, Design of Experiments (DoE), Testing and Analysis of Experiments (AE). Each stage allows the developer to select certain features then used in the subsequent stage. During the completion of all stages, the developer can select relevant standards, their options, test beds with all qualified and test equipment as well their attributes or functions used during the testing. The proposed methodology summarizes a set of best practices the developer could follow to complete in a smooth way a smart grid interoperability test.\nFig.1 A schematic overview of the JRC Interoperability testing methodology\nIn this test case, we will investigate through the interoperability validation tests, the interaction and information exchange between the involved actors for a flexibility activation event. This event will be triggered by a local node voltage disturbance and followed by a consequent flexibility request. To this end, we will analyze voltage restoration level, time and control. Function(s) under Investigation (FuI) Voltage restore, activation and restoration time for interoperability profiles (BAIOP), validate the interfaces between the actors involved in the flexibility activation chain, impact to the grid.\nIn this use case, we will analyze the performance of the “voltage restoration” function, after a voltage disturbance occurs in the power grid when different system variables (input factors) are considered and changed. The performance of this function is assessed an interoperability point of view, where different system variables (input factors) potentially affecting the system performance are considered and their effect on the system response is analysed. A reference grid model will be used (JRA1.1?).\nObject under Investigation (OuI) The actual components and equipment under testing, e.g. communication infrastructure categorized by its technology (cable, Fiber, local Etherent, xDSL, etc.), controllers (e.g., RTU and Flexibility run in single-boards computers like Raspberry Pi), etc.\nDomain under Investigation (DuI)  Communication/ICT/Control Electrical Power System  Purpose of Investigation (PoI) Pol#1: Evaluate the interoperability between the involved actors and the different components in the system (flexibility provider, requester, other intermediates).

The overall interoperability evaluation for the test will be in the form of a final “pass/fail” form. For PoI#2, the time that the system needs to activate the voltage support mechanism and successfully restore the voltage to acceptable levels will be evaluated. It should be also mentioned that although both PoI can be met by TS 24.01, multiple interfaces (each one corresponding to a different BAIOP) depending on the selected telecommunication technology will be tested for the two communication links under consideration (DSO ↔ RTU and RTU ↔ Device).

This is seen as the most cost-effective path in developing smart grids. An essential part of any functional power system are substations; thus, their digitalization is crucial. While the digitalization of power system brings several benefits from cost savings to more optimized operations and investments, it also raises concerns related to cybersecurity.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope A local energy community - With the new Clean Energy Package, private households are encouraged not only to generate and consume energy, to market the flexibility of controllable producers and consumers in the future, but also to make energy available to each other and to share generated energy. In the future energy distribution network, the new regulatory framework, technical developments and grid fee mechanisms canmotivate households to found and/or join energy communities with the aim to maximize the consumption of locally generated energy. Communities with a high penetration of photovoltaic systems and correspondingly large installed generation capacity can be expected to generate an energy surplus during times of peak generation and low local demand, and vice versa to run into an energy deficit during seasons of low generation. Surplus energy can be stored and shifted to times of low generation in order to satisfy temporary demand and hence increase the degree of self-sufficiency up to 100%.  Networks: LV  Markets: None   Objective(s) -\tMaximize consumption of local generation/Minimize demand satisfied by public grid  -\tIslanding of local grid by making use of flexible loads and storages  -\tMaximizing duration of islanding operation -\tUC 1 is prerequisite for UC 2 to 4   Related business case(s) no    1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThe use case “Islanding” of an energy community aims to balance generation and demand of a local energy community in such a way that the load flow across the connecting MV/LV transformer is reduced to a minimum. The balancing is enabled by an energy management systems called Avacon Local Flex Controller (ALF-C). The ALF-C monitors the power flow across the transformer and controls a battery energy storage system (BESS) connected directly to the LV-terminal of the substation. Generated energy surplus will be stored in the BESS and released at times of a generation deficit. Private households equipped with batteries and controllable electric heaters can be dispatched to increase the degree of self-sufficiency further.\nComplete description\nThe Clean Energy for all Europeans Package, encourages private households are not only to generate and consume energy, to market the flexibility of controllable producers and consumers in the future, but also to make energy available to each other and to share self-generated energy. In the future energy distribution network, the new regulatory framework, technical development and grid fee mechanisms can motivate households to found and/or join energy communities with the aim to maximize the consumption of locally generated energy. This will lead to a change in the behaviors of electrical energy exchange along the grid connection point of the MV/LV grid and consequently load flows along the MV-lines. A local Energy Management System (EMS) named (Avacon Local Flex Controller –( ALF-C) will monitor local generation, demand and storage capacities and control available flexibilities in such a way that consumption of locally generated energy will be maximized. When local generation exceeds local demand, surplus energy will automatically be stored in local storages and the consumption of available flexible loads will be increased. When local consumption is exceeding local generation, stored electrical energy in local batteries will be discharged. The target is to minimize the load flow exchange at the MV/LV grid connection to a level at which the community is virtually islanded. In cases where generation and demand can not be balanced due to a lack of available storage capacity or flexibility, the residual load will exported/imported. A sensor located at the grid connection will measure the power exchange of all 3 phases between the medium voltage and low voltage grid. The measured values indicate the residual demand or export of surplus of generated energy/power. Data is provided to the EMS an based on the information increases or decreases the load in order balance the grid. Additionally, customer households provide flexible load and storage capacities for steering. Flexible assets in the field are equipped with sensors and controllers for steering to increase or decrease demand and to command charging or discharging of local large Battery Energy Storage System and private customer household storages. Vendors of flexible assets provide a cloud data management platform from which measurement data are accessible for EMS via an backend. The interface also provides data to sensors located in private customer households will provide measurements of energy consumption and provide the necessary data for EMS to estimate the state of charge of batteries or flexible loads and potential available storage capacity. With Hhistorical measurement data and weather forecasts provided by external service providers enable the EMS to predict energy generation and consumption to maximize self-sufficiency. Controllers Actuators enable EMSC to switch on and off, increase or decrease energy consumption of individual loads, such as storage heaters and heat pumps, and storages located in private households and the large scale storage located in the community. The communication between sensors, actuators controllers and EMSC will be web based, via LTE or DSL and open protocols. Customers shall not sacrifice comfort due to a decrease of room heating. The operation of the community in an “Island” mode will be initiated by the operator.\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope Communities with a high penetration of photovoltaic systems and correspondingly high installed generation capacity can be expected to generate an energy surplus during times of peak generation and low local demand, and vice versa to run into an energy deficit during seasons of low generation. Surplus energy can be stored and shifted to times of low generation in order to satisfy temporary demand and hence increase the degree of self-sufficiency. Use Case 2 demonstrates how the flexibility required to enable a local balancing mechanism could temporarily be allocated to other uses, for example the provision of flexibility to a third party, e.g. the connecting grid operator. Use Case 2 uses the available flexibility in a given local energy community to maintain an externally defined non-zero setpoint at the point of connection.  Networks: LV  Markets: None   Objective(s) Maintain a fixed non-zero power exchange between energy community and the distribution network for a limited duration.   Related business case(s) Integration of local energy communities in network management strategies for the stabilization and uniform utilization in distribution grid    1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nLocal energy communities are likely to emerge in Europe in the near future but will most likely retain an interconnection to the distribution grid. These communities will require a large share of flexibility to enable their primary use case. Situations could arise that require the community to provide flexibility to third parties – driven by technical circumstances or following economic considerations (market incentives). Use Case 2 demonstrates the ability and practical feasibility of a local community to maintain constant non-zero power exchange with the distribution network for a previously defined duration.\nComplete description\nThe community is consuming and/or generating energy. A user (in the case of the field trial the DSO) triggers the EMS to apply Use Case 2 and sets a target value (P’Breaker) for the power exchange at the grid connection. The EMS (ALF-C) processes weather forecasts and measurement values from the grid connection and flexible assets such as BESS, household energy storages and flexible loads located in the community. Based on the data and historic values the EMS forecasts the local generation and demands and determines the best strategy to reach (P’Breaker) by utilizing the available flexibility to keep the power flow constant for a pre-defined duration.  The EMS communicates with sensors through the Blockchain Access Platform and DSO Technical Platform and handles all data in a dedicated data base. The DSO Technical Platform provides encryption and decryption in the whole IT infrastructure. Control signals are routed through the DSO technical platform and the Blockchain Access Platform to flexible devices, if applicable through a third-party backend that connects to the hardware.\n1.5.

These communities are unlikely to meet their own needs with locally generated energy throughout the year and will potentially run into energy-deficit in times of low local generation. Energy deficits could be compensated by the supplying distribution network. To reduce the stress on the mid-voltage feeder and reduce overall network cost, energy deficits occurring could be forecasted and delivered in discrete packages ahead of time at fixed time slots and be stored in local storages until demand arises.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nLocal energy communities (LEC, CEC) are likely to emerge in Europe in the near future but will most likely retain an interconnection to the distribution grid. These communities will require a large share of flexibility to enable their primary use case (islanding).  In the absence of sufficient generation and storage, the community is unlikely to be self-sufficient at all times. When energy deficits occur, they must be provided by the distribution network. Instead of a real time energy supply by the connected distribution network, energy deficits could be forecast and supplied as an energy package with a defined time, duration and power value for the load exchange at the LV/ MV-grid connection point that connects the community with the distribution grid. The energy package shall be stored in local storages within the community and available for use, when the demand is rising. Outside of the defined periods of energy provision, no power exchange shall all the grid connection point shall take place, according to DE-UC1. This use case enables the DSO to reduce overall network costs, for example by gaining the ability to stagger the demand of multiple communities along a single feeder, thusly reducing the factor of coincidence of peak load and peak load level accordingly.\nComplete description\nadd text - longer narrative from user viewpoint about what happens how, where, when, why and under which assumptions.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope Communities with a high penetration of photovoltaic systems and correspondingly high installed generation capacity can be expected to generate an energy surplus during times of peak generation and low local demand, and vice versa to run into an energy deficit during seasons of low generation. Surplus energy can be stored and shifted to times of low generation in order to satisfy temporary demand and hence increase the degree of self-sufficiency. Use Case 2 demonstrates how the flexibility required to enable a local balancing mechanism could temporarily be allocated to other uses, for example the provision of flexibility to a third party, e.g. the connecting grid operator. Use Case 2 uses the available flexibility in a given local energy community to maintain an externally defined non-zero setpoint at the point of connection.

In the absence of sufficient generation and storage, the community is unlikely to be self-sufficient at all times.

Instead of a real time energy export to the connected distribution network, energy surplus could be forecast and exported delayed as an energy package within a defined time, duration and power value for the load exchange at the LV/ MV-grid connection point. The generated energy surplus first shall be stored in local storages located within the community and be exported as an energy package delayed, when the load in the upper grid decreases. Outside of the defined periods of energy export, no power exchange shall take place, according to DE-UC1.

The schedule can be defined for a duration for the next 1 to 24 hours.  The schedule contains time slots for the export of energy in which P’Breaker ≠ 0 and time slots in which no power shall be exchange along the grid connection point (P’Breaker = 0), following the principle of UC 1. During the application of UC 4 the total amount of exported energy shall meet the total amount of the residual energy surplus that the community will generate. The generated surplus will therefore have to be forecasted by the user. In times P’Breaker = 0 the generated surplus will have to be stored in local battery energy storages systems. In times P’Breaker ≠ 0, local batteries will be triggered to discharge in order to export generated surplus from LV into MV grid. To maintain the given setpoint P’Breaker deficits shall be covered by energy provided by batteries located in the local network whereas generated surplus shall be buffered in available batteries.  After the user input has been confirmed the EMS begins with the application of UC 4. The EMS receives weather forecasts provided by an external service provider and measurement values provided by sensors located at the LV/MV grid connection point, flexible assets such as BESS, household energy storages and flexible loads as well as household grid connection points. Based on the received data and historic measurements values the EMS forecasts the local generation and demands and determines the best strategy to reach and maintain the setpoint schedule by utilizing the available flexibility for the pre-defined duration.  A sensor located at the grid connection will measure the power exchange of all 3 phases with the MV grid PBreaker and provide data to the EMS. Based on the information the EMS determines deviations between PBreaker and P’Breaker and dispatches setpoints to increases or decreases the load in the grid in order to reach P’Breaker. Additionally, sensors located in private customer households will provide measurements of energy consumption and SOC/SOE of storages and provide data to the EMS. With historical measurement data and weather forecast provided by external service providers enable the EMS to predict energy generation and consumption to maximize the duration of time of maintaining P’Breaker.  In cases generation and demand cannot be balanced to reach (P’Breaker) due to a lack of available storage capacity or flexibility, the use case will be terminated.\n1.5.

The estimated network state will be used as an input to distribution management applications.

Narrative of Use Case Short description The UC investigates the capability of the state estimation tool to filter the available measurement data, comprising actual measurements obtained from active metering devices and pseudo-measurements, i.e. data derived from load forecasting or RES scheduling for network observability accomplishment, in order to identify measurements with gross errors (bad data), to suppress measurement errors, to reconcile inconsistent data and, ultimately, to estimate the actual operational network state.\nComplete description The DSO operates the distribution network. A measurement set, composed of actual and historical measurement data obtained from the dispersed metering devices (AMR, GIS, SCADA) installed throughout the network, is available for real-time operation purposes. The related measurements refer to power flows and voltage magnitudes at the top of distribution feeders, power injections from distributed generation units, and load pseudo-measurements for aggregated consumer demand at MV/LV transformer level. Given that the network model (topology) is known with a good degree of certainty, the state estimation tool ensures that the network is observable based on the available measurement set and, subsequently, calculates the estimated state vector, that is, the voltage magnitudes and angles of all network buses.\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope The scope of the UC is the integration of measurement data obtained from PMUs into the State Estimation tool.   Objective(s) * To reinforce network observability and controllability via improved state estimation performance. * To ensure smooth incorporation of synchronised measurement data derived from PMUs into the preexisting system of conventional measurements.   Related business case(s) add text    Notes:\n Scope - describes the aims and boundaries of the use case in a short, precise text. Objective(s) - goals of the use case, in form of bullet points and a short headline. Realted business case(s) - optional  1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description Measurement data obtained from the installed PMUs are integraded in the State Estimation tool and used to enhance the network observability. The installation of PMUs at selected buses is sure to upgrade the overall metering infrastructure of the network, since they record synchronized measurements of bus voltage phasors as well as a number of line current phasors—all of which are independent of each other and count as individual measurements. Yet, their proper utilization via the SE tool is a challenging task due to a) the intense discrepancies in update rates between conventional and PMU measurements, b) the provision of current measurements which often lead to various numerical problems, and c) the contrast between the large weighting factors linked to PMU measurements compared to the much lower ones linked to pseudo-measurements, which usually raises ill-conditioning issues. The goal is to ensure that the integration of PMU data will be smooth and all the aforesaid problems will be circumvented.\nComplete description A measurement set, composed of actual and historical measurement data obtained from the dispersed metering devices (AMR, GIS, SCADA, PMUs) installed throughout the network, is available to the DSO for real-time operation purposes. The aforementioned data refer to a) synchronised measurements of bus voltage phasors and line current phasors (magnitude and angle) and b) conventional measurements of power flows and voltage magnitudes at the top of distribution feeders, power injections from distributed generation units, and load pseudo-measurements for aggregated consumer demand at MV/LV transformer level. Given that the network model (topology) is known with a good degree of certainty, the state estimation tool ensures that the network is observable based on the available measurement set, reconciles the PMU data with the conventional measurements, and, subsequently, calculates the estimated state vector, that is, the voltage magnitudes and angles of all network buses. Given the successful integration and use of the PMU data in the SE tool, the overall performance of the SE tool will be enhanced; the network state will be calculated with increased precision compared to conventional-measurements-only scenarios (uc-GR-1), and high quality real-time operational standards for distribution management applications will be met.\n1.5.

State of the network is known with a good degree of certainty based on the state vector that the state estimation tool produces using the available measurements and the topology data from the AMR, GIS, SCADA and PMUs. The DSO communicates network tariffs in a day-ahead context. These tariffs appropriately reflect the potential of the network exceeding its physical limits resulting in violations and/or curtailment of demand/generation. Compared to the business as usual scenario of the flat network tariffs, the DSO aims at reducing such negative effects by the use of variable day-ahead network tariffs, which incentivise the appropriate actions of the -assumed as- rational users of the distribution network.\nadd text - longer narrative from user viewpoint about what happens how, where, when, why and under which assumptions.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope The scope of the UC is to examine the integration and operational use of low cost PMUs in order to increase network observability collecting measurement data such as voltage, current and phases in various points of the distribution network. More in detail, the DSO will use the data collected to improve the operation of the tools and services developed within the project by exploiting increased data granularity. Furthermore, the data coming from various sources and systems of the DSO should be integrated in the DSO Technical Platform having first passed through the Blockchain Access Platform developed in the project to provide data access security and data integrity. In addition, all the available data should be further delivered for use by tools and services developed in order to support flexibility mechanisms. All the appropriate communication protocols should be integrated and tested to develop a unique point of data delivery to various actors involved in the project and a User Interface (UI) should be developed to allow the DSO personnel to use the available tools and services.   Objective(s) * To increase network observability.  * To integrate data coming from different sources in the DSO Technical Platform.   Related business case(s) add text    Notes:\n Scope - describes the aims and boundaries of the use case in a short, precise text. Objective(s) - goals of the use case, in form of bullet points and a short headline. Realted business case(s) - optional  1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description PMUs are installed in critical network nodes to increase network observability. PMU measurements along with other DSO data (network topology, customer loads, etc) are integrated in the DSO Technical Platform to be visulalised in a User Interface (UI), so that DSO can make use of tools and services developed in the project. Aforementioned data is going through the Blockchain Access Platform developed in the project to ensure data access security and data integrity.\nComplete description\nThe DSO operates the distribution network and handles the data sources coming from various systems such as SCADA/DMS, AMR, GIS etc. Data coming from various sources get integrated into the Open DSO Technical Platform providing an adequate level of network observability. Low cost PMUs are deployed in Mesogia area in critical network points and nodes where there is limited observability or a requirement to have an increased awareness such as DER and prosumers bidirectional power flows. Also, PMU data are integrated in the DSO Technical Platform following a data collection plan that serves the functionalities of the flexibility tools and services. Measurements from PMUs enhance network awareness in terms of data granularity and number of nodes observed in a cost effective manner. Also, the open DSO Technical Platform performs the correlation of the data coming from different sources and systems during real time, providing to the DSO the technical capacity for flexibility mechanisms support and a User Interface (UI) where the aforementioned is visualised. All data is verified and secured by the use of blockchain technology to be developed in the Blockhain Access Platform of the project.\n1.5.

The DSO can use flexible resources connected to the distribution system and the TSO can use flexible resources connected to distribution systems under the DSO’s approval. The state estimation is assessed and monitored by the DSO in order to keep the electrical quantities within admissible ranges.\nIn the day ahead market, the FR Owner sends to Aggregator Platform the list of the resources available for the day after. The list is subsequently transmitted by the Aggregator Platform to the Shared Customer Database (SCD). For each Point of delivery (PODs), the SCD collects quarterly measures and data useful for flexibility and sends them to the DSO Technical Platform, the TSO simulator and the Aggregator Platform.\nOther three processes take place parallelly:\n Detection of voltage violations on the distribution grid by the DSO Technical Platform and definition of local flexibility requests, in the event the issue cannot be solved through its own solutions; Definition of voltage violations on the transmission network by the TSO simulator and request of flexibility to solve them in HV grid; Gathering by the Aggregator Platform of flexibility offers from customers in LV and MV and offering to the Market.  At gate closure, all day ahead requests and offers are stored in the Market Platform, which matches first the offers with the DSO’s requests, and orders them economically; then, it repeats the same procedure with the TSO requests.\nThe list of awarded offers is sent to DSO TP for evaluating the grid constraints violations. Finally, the market platform receives the list of offers compliant with local grid constraints and sends it to all the stakeholders. At this step, the Aggregator Platform sends a reservation to the FR Owner for the resources that will be selected for the day-ahead market.\nThe same steps are also followed in the Real Time sessions. Indeed, in these Market sessions, the offers to be matched with DSO and TSO Real Time requests are the ones still valid because not matched in previous market sessions.\nThe activation phase begins when the DSO and TSO need flexibility. The DSO TP and the TSO simulator communicate to the market Platform to move a specific offer. The Market Platform sends the order to the DSO TP, that divides it for every POD and dispatches the set point to the light nodes. The light nodes make available the set points to the BMS and measures the electrical quantities to be sent to the SCD for evaluate the energy flexibility. For the settlement phase, the Market Platform acquires data from the SCD and calculates the difference between market baseline, evaluated by BRP, and electrical quantities measured in the same time frame, uploaded in the SCD by Light Nodes. The Market Platform runs the settlement algorithm and finds the outcomes. Settlement outcomes are transmitted to the Aggregator Platform, the DSO and the TSO Simulator.\nFinally, the DSO pays the flexibility to the aggregator, that can pay the fee to the FR Owner.\n1.5.

The state estimation is assessed and monitored by the DSO in order to keep the electrical quantities within admissible ranges In the day ahead market, the FR Owner sends to Aggregator Platform the list of the resources available for the day after. The list is subsequently transmitted by the Aggregator Platform to the Shared Customer Database (SCD). For each Point of delivery (PODs), the SCD collects quarterly measures and data useful for flexibility and sends them to the DSO Technical Platform, the TSO simulator and the Aggregator Platform.\nOther three processes take place parallelly:\n  Detection of congestion issues on the distribution grid by the DSO Technical Platform and definition of local flexibility requests, in the event the issue cannot be solved through its own solutions;\n  Definition of congestion issues on the transmission network by the TSO simulator and request of flexibility to solve them in HV grid;\n  Gathering by the Aggregator Platform of flexibility offers from customers in LV and MV and offering to the Market.\n  At gate closure, all day ahead requests and offers are stored in the Market Platform, which matches first the offers with the DSO’s requests, and orders them economically; then, it repeats the same procedure with the TSO requests.\nThe list of awarded offers is sent to DSO TP for evaluating the grid constraints violations. Finally, the market platform receives the list of offers compliant with local grid constraints and sends it to all the stakeholders.\nAt this step, the Aggregator Platform sends a reservation to the FR Owner for the resources that will be selected for the day-ahead market. The same steps are also followed in the Real Time sessions. Indeed, in these Market sessions, the offers to be matched with DSO and TSO Real Time requests are the ones still valid because not matched in previous market sessions.\nThe activation phase begins when the DSO and TSO need flexibility. The DSO TP and the TSO simulator communicate to the market Platform to move a specific offer. The Market Platform sends the order to the DSO TP, that divides it for every POD and dispatches the set point to the light nodes. The light nodes make available the set points to the BMS and measures the electrical quantities to be sent to the SCD for evaluate the energy flexibility.\nFor the settlement phase, the Market Platform acquires data from the SCD and calculates the difference between market baseline, evaluated by BRP, and electrical quantities measured in the same time frame, uploaded in the SCD by Light Nodes. The Market Platform runs the settlement algorithm and finds the outcomes. Settlement outcomes are transmitted to the Aggregator Platform, the DSO and the TSO Simulator.\nFinally, the DSO pays the flexibility to the aggregator, that can pay the fee to the FR Owner.\n1.5.

Objective(s) This information is needed to perform correctly algorithms (State Estimation, State Forecasting, Optimal Power Flow, and control actions in order to increase the network reliability and performance.  Related business\ncase(s)      1.4 Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThe data collection for the LV grid is performed storing real-time measurements (mean values and PQ indexes), states and alarms in a unique repository – located in the Secondary Substation – after managing some implementation issues, such as protocol conversion and writing of data into the SSAU.RDBMS.\n“Real-time” in this context means something in between 1 second and some minutes.\nComplete description\nOn the LV grid, several monitoring devices will be installed:\n Smart Meters (SM) on the connection point of LV customers/productions. Data of SMs are often collected by a Meter Data Collector (MDC) system, installed in the secondary substation and aggregated in an Automatic Metering Management system (AMM) located in the control center.   Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), Power Quality Meters (PQMs) or – more in general – Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs)  Data considered by the use case is:\n  Mean values of V, I, Q, P:\n  LV busbars, LV side of transformers and LV lines in secondary substations (RTU, IED)\n  On the connection point of LV customers/productions (SM/MDC)\n    Load profiles from LV customers and generations (SM/MDC)\n  PQ indexes both from the secondary substations and from some relevant nodes of the LV grid, such has street cabinets (PQM)\n  Status of remote-controllable elements in secondary substations (RTU-IED)\n  breakers/disconnectors\n  tap changer of MV/LV transformers\n  voltage or reactive power set-points for generation connected on the LV network\n    Alarms related to events and faults (IED-PQM-RTU)\n  Measures, events and states not provided by those devices are provided by the Distribution Management System (DMS).\nMeasures, events and states from the MV side of the secondary substation should be considered as well. In that case they will be transfer to the primary substation by the DMS.\nMeasures are fetched by using:\n  the IEC61850 protocols (mainly MMS) and stored into the database which presents a data model compliant with the IEC61850 for the general monitoring of the LV grid (from RTUs, IEDs, DMS…)\n  DLMS/COSEM protocol for the communication with electronic meters(EM)\n   Protocol conversion have to be implemented before writing the data – collected from different sources – into the SSAU.RDBMS to enable the execution of other use cases.\nThe SSAU.RDBMS should contain a Data layer, composed by a relational database, where the data are written.\nThe SSAU.Monitoring must include an Interface layer which implements required communication protocols and which is able to extract data from other systems.\nThe SSAU.Reporting is composed of an Application layer, which analyses the data to:\n  calculate statistical values such as min, max, avg, std, etc.\n  generate reports for the primary substation/DMS\n  1.5 General Remarks 2 Diagrams of Use Case Diagram 1   Diagram 2   Diagram 3   -- 3 Technical Details 3.1 Actors   Actor Name Actor Type Actor Description Further information specific to this Use Case    DIED.SM function Smart Meter (SM)\nDef. 1\nMeter with additional functionalities one of which is data communication.\nDef. 2\nThe metering end device is a combination of the following meter-related functions from the Smart Metering reference architecture: Metrology functions including the conventional meter display (register or index) that are under legal metrological control.

Step by Step Analysis of Use Case 4.1. Overview of Scenarios    No. Scenario Name Primary Actor Triggering Event Pre-Condition Post-Condition     1         Notes This part describes the possible scenarios of the use case. The scenarios should comply with the sequence diagrams in Sect. 2 of the template, so that every step describes one part of a communication or action. Apart from a normal success scenario, different failure scenarios or alternatives can be included to describe situations where preconditions are not satisfied or unwanted states are attained.\n Primary Actor - the first actor appearing in the scenario at the incident causing the scenario to begin. Triggering Event - the incident causing the scenario to begin. Pre-Condition - indicates which terms have to be fulfilled for the scenario to be executed. Post-Condition - indicates which terms should be valid after the scenario. TIt can also specify whether a scenario has been successfully completed or not.  4.2.
