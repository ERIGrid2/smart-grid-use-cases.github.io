## 1.3. Scope and Objectives of Use Case

*Scope and objectives of use case*
|||
| --- | --- |
| Scope | The scope of the UC is to examine the operational use of flexibility tools in order to satisfy EN50160 in case of a voltage level violation in the distribution network and especially in MV lines with flexible loads availability. The DSO will examine the operation of tools and services for decision making support to mitigate voltage violations, assuming that the grid state estimation has a good degree of certainty . <br/> Network: MV <br/> Markets: Near Real Time|
| **Objective(s)** | * To monitor and control the voltage level at a network node always into the operational limit. <br/> * To immediately respond in case of a violation employing flexibility capabilities.|

## 1.4. Narrative of Use Case


**Short description**
Various types of flexible loads -aggregated for the scope of the Use Case- react to network tariffs sent by the DSO, so that voltage limit violation is mitigated.

**Complete description**
Customers with flexible loads are connected to the distribution network and their loads are considered aggregated for the scope of the UCs regarding their management in the MV level. State of the network is known with a good degree of certainty based on the available measurements and the topology via the AMR, GIS and SCADA data. In the first case: a) via the state estimation tool, it is identified that a voltage limit is violated on a node, in a second case: b) an alarm coming from the SCADA/DMS informs us for an undervoltage in an MV line that is controlled by DSO Regional Control Centre. The alarm signal is transferred in the DSO technical platform via an API and the information is shared with the appropriate tools and services. The DSO calculated and communicated the appropriate network tariffs that reflect the situation of the network. The flexible loads react to these tariffs and the problem is mitigated.
