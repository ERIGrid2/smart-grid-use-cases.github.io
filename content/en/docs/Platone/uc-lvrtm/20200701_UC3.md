1.4. Narrative of Use Case
--------------------------

**Short description**

Local energy communities (LEC, CEC) are likely to emerge in Europe in
the near future but will most likely retain an interconnection to the
distribution grid. These communities will require a large share of
flexibility to enable their primary use case (islanding).

In the absence of sufficient generation and storage, the community is
unlikely to be self-sufficient at all times. When energy deficits occur,
they must be provided by the distribution network. Instead of a real
time energy supply by the connected distribution network, energy
deficits could be forecast and supplied as an energy package with a
defined time, duration and power value for the load exchange at the LV/
MV-grid connection point that connects the community with the
distribution grid. The energy package shall be stored in local storages
within the community and available for use, when the demand is rising.
Outside of the defined periods of energy provision, no power exchange
shall all the grid connection point shall take place, according to
DE-UC1. This use case enables the DSO to reduce overall network costs,
for example by gaining the ability to stagger the demand of multiple
communities along a single feeder, thusly reducing the factor of
coincidence of peak load and peak load level accordingly.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Formation of energy communities in future distribution grid       The Clean Energy Package has to be implemented by national regulation and legislations, enabling the formation of energy communities.
  Integration of battery storage in control mechanisms of the DSO   The local energy community has the ability to forecast net-energy deficit day ahead and can accept and follow power setpoints as defined by the DSO.
  DSO supply mechanism for local energy communities                 The DSO is enabled and capable to apply novel supply strategies to energy communities, moving away from real-time supply to a package-based philosophy.
