### 1.2 Narrative of Use Case

**Short description**

Use case 1 is anticipated to emerge as a result of the Clean Energy Package, driven by the bottom.up demand of customers and local communities. It is a prerequisite for the advanced use cases 2-4 which investigate ways to coordinate the interconnected distribution network with local energy communities.


**Complete description**

Complete description - longer narrative from user viewpoint about what happens how, where, when,
why, and under which assumptions. It has to be written in a way that it can also be understood by non-experts.
