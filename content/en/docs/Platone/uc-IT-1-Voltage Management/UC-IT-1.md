## 1.4. Narrative of Use Case


**Short description**

This BUC describes the main steps to avoid congestion in transmission and distribution systems. The DSO can use flexible resources connected to the distribution system and TSO can use flexible resources connected to transmission and distribution systems after the DSO’s approval. The power flow is assessed and monitored respectively by DSO and TSO, in order to keep the electrical quantities within admissible ranges.

**Complete description**

The decentralization of the electricity system brings an increase of the generation power plants connected in Medium and in Low Voltage, on the other hand the mobility electrification, especially in the urban areas, requires a broad widespread of fast and slow charging points, so the management of the distribution system have to change to face this new challenges.
This new scenario also involves the transmission level, because a lot of high voltage power plant are no longer convenient, so they will close. Therefore the services for the network stabilization provided today by the HV plants, in the future will be required to the DER connected in medium and in low voltage.
So in the next years the active role of DSO in the flexibility services, it’s crucial for the of the electricity system. 
In Italy, since July 2017, ARERA – the Italian Authority for the Electricity market regulation – has launched pilot projects to involve the resources connected in medium and low voltage in the flexibility market. In these projects the TSO can use the resources connected to the distribution grid to solve some HV issues.
However a complete framework about the local flexibility market have to define and in this demo we describe a contribute. 
The main points of the Italian demo are:
-	Inclusivity: every customer connected to distribution grid must be able to participate;
-	Interoperability: the device used to enable the users have to be interoperable, for avoid the lock-in phenomenon;
-	Transparent: the energy provided in the flexibility market is certificated and communicated to the customer.
The UC deals the voltage violation on transmission and distribution grid, describing all the main phases: procurement, activation and settlement, in the day ahead and real time flexibility market.
In the day ahead the DSO Technical Platform detects the voltage violation on the distribution grid and the TSO simulator defines the voltage violation on the transmission network. The DSO try first to solve the issues using the own technologies, after it uses the local flexibility market, defining the local flexibility requests and communicating to TSO the new load and voltage profile in Primary Substation.
In parallel the TSO requires the flexibility to solve the voltage violation in HV grid to the local market. 
Finally, the aggregator gathers the flexibility from the customers in low and in medium voltage and offer it to the market
At gate closure, all the day ahead requests and offers are stored on the market platform. The market operator matches first the offers with the DSO’s requests, and arranges them in economic order, after repeats the procedure with the TSO requests. Hence the list of auctioned offer is sent to DSO Technical Platform for evaluate the grid constraints violations. In the end the market operator receives the list of offers comply with local grid constraints and sends them to all the stakeholders.
The same steps are used for the Real Time session, where the DSO and TSO can add or change the flexibility requests using the day ahead offers.
When the DSO or the TSO need of flexibility, begin the Activation phase, where the DSO or TSO communicate the order to market for move a specific offer, the market operator sends the set-point for every PODs to the DSO Technical Platform, which sends it to every light nodes. The light node makes available the set points to the EMS. Finally, the Light Node measures the electrical quantities for evaluate the energy flexibility and sends them to the Shared Customer Database (SCD).
For the settlement the market operator acquires the data from the SCD and calculates the difference between market baseline and electrical quantities measured in the same time frame. The outcomes are shared with Aggregator, DSO and TSO, who can recognize the respective economic items.
The enabling technologies used in the use case are:
-	the SCD: this database shares the data with the stakeholders ensuring the transparency;
-	the Light Node: this device break down the barriers to entry market and ensuring the interoperability and inclusivity;
-	the blockchain Access layer: this technologies grantees the reliability and safety of the transactions.
