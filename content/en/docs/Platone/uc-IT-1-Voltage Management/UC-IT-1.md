## 1.4. Narrative of Use Case


**Short description**

This BUC describes the main steps to avoid congestion in transmission and distribution systems. The DSO can use flexible resources connected to the distribution system and TSO can use flexible resources connected to transmission and distribution systems after the DSO’s approval. The power flow is assessed and monitored respectively by DSO and TSO, in order to keep the electrical quantities within admissible ranges.

**Complete description**

The UC deals the Voltage Violation on transmission and distribution grid, describing all the main phases: procurement, activation and settlement, in the day ahead and real time flexibility market.
In the day ahead market, the FR Owner sends to Aggregator Platform the list of the resources available for the day after. Subsequently the Aggregator Platform transmits the list to the SCD. For every POD, the SCD joins the quarterly measures and all the main data useful for the flexibility and sends them to DSO TP, TSO simulator and Aggregator Platform. 
In parallel take place three processes :
-	The DSO Technical Platform detects the voltage violation on the distribution grid. The DSO try first to solve the issues using the own solutions, after it uses the local flexibility market, defining the local flexibility requests;
-	The TSO simulator defines the voltage violations on the transmission network and requires the flexibility to solve the congestion in HV grid to the local market;
-	The Aggregator Platform gathers the flexibility from the customers in low and in medium voltage and offer it to the market platform.
At gate closure all the day ahead requests and offers are stored on the Market Platform. The Market Platform matches first the offers with the DSO’s requests, and orders them in economic manner, after repeats the procedure with the TSO requests. Hence the list of auctioned offers is sent to DSO TP for evaluate the grid constraints violations. Finally the market platform receives the list of offers comply with local grid constraints and sends them to all the stakeholders.
Moreover the Aggregator Platform sends a reservation to FR Owner for the resources that will be select for the market day ahead.
The same steps are followed in the Real Time session. The only variation is in the Aggregator domain. Indeed the aggregator uses in Real Time session the same offers proposed in the Day ahead market, hence all the requests that DSO and TSO makes in Real Time are matched with the offers presented in the previous session.
When the DSO or the TSO need of flexibility, begin the Activation phase, where the DSO TP or TSO Simulator communicate to market the order to move tied to a specific offer. The Market Platform sends the order to DSO TP, that divides it for every POD and dispatches the set point to light nodes. The light nodes make available the set points to the BMS/FR. Also, the Light Node measures the electrical quantities for evaluate the energy flexibility and sends them to the SCD.
For the settlement phase the Market Platform acquires the data from the SCD and calculates the difference between market baseline, uploaded in the SCD by BRP, and electrical quantities measured in the same time frame, uploaded in the SCD by Light Node. The Market Platform runs the settlement algorithm and finds the outcomes. The settlement outcomes are transmitted to Aggregator Platform, DSO and TSO Simulator.
Finally, the DSO pays the flexibility to the aggregator, that can recognizes the fee to the FR Owner.
