## 1.3. Scope and Objectives of Use Case

*Scope and objectives of use case*

|||
| --- | --- |
| Scope | Energy communities with a high proportion of self-generation and flexible consumers and storage can maximize the self-consumption of locally generated energy. These communities are unlikely to meet their own needs with locally generated energy throughout the year and will potentially run into energy-deficit in times of low local generation. Energy deficits could be compensated by the supplying distribution network. To reduce the stress on the mid-voltage feeder and reduce overall network cost, energy deficits occurring could be forecasted and delivered in discrete packages ahead of time at fixed time slots and be stored in local storages until demand arises. <br/> Networks: LV, MV <br/> Markets: None|
| **Objective(s)** | •	Enabling temporary islanding even in times of energy deficit of the local community <br/> •	Forecasting of residual energy demand of an energy community <br/> •	Calculation of required energy packages serving energy deficits <br/> •	Determination of power exchange schedule for the energy community for the grid connection point LV/MV (time and power of load exchange) <br/> •	Determination of a setpoint schedule for individual local asset to meet energy community setpoint schedule <br/> •	Execution of defined power exchange between energy community and the distribution network|
| **Related business case(s)** |Integration of local energy communities in network management and supply strategies for the stabilization and uniform utilization in distribution grid|

## 1.4. Narrative of Use Case


**Short description**

Local energy communities (LEC, CEC) are likely to emerge in Europe in the near future but will most likely retain an interconnection to the distribution grid. These communities will require a large share of flexibility to enable their primary use case (islanding). <br/> In the absence of sufficient generation and storage, the community is unlikely to be self-sufficient at all times. When energy deficits occur, they must be provided by the distribution network. Instead of a real time energy supply by the connected distribution network, energy deficits could be forecast and supplied as an energy package with a defined time, duration and power value for the load exchange at the LV/ MV-grid connection point that connects the community with the distribution grid. The energy package shall be stored in local storages within the community and available for use, when the demand is rising. Outside of the defined periods of energy provision, no power exchange shall all the grid connection point shall take place, according to DE-UC1. This use case enables the DSO to reduce overall network costs, for example by gaining the ability to stagger the demand of multiple communities along a single feeder, thusly reducing the factor of coincidence of peak load and peak load level accordingly.
