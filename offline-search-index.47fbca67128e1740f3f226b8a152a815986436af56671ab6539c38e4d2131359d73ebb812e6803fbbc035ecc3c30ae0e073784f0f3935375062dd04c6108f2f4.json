This imbalance will result in activation of the droop controllers and the possible subsequent stabilization. The same test will have to be repeated several times for five (5) different initial conditions depending on the type of disturbance.\nInitial system state There are five possible initial states for the system in terms of frequency and voltage values.

The order of actions is fixed and predefined through the programming parameters of the control system, whereas the reconnection timing should happen automatically at times when voltage and frequency are within specific boundaries.\nSpecific Test System The test setup depicted above comprises one BS controller (as part of the DMS), three loads with controllable switches, three transducers for the voltage measurement at each load (on the breaker’s side), one transducer for the measurement of frequency and one controllable source which provides the voltage/frequency controllability required for validating the controller behavior.\nTarget measures  Power outage time Reconnection times Voltage/frequency values  Input and output parameters Input parameters\n Frequency Voltage  Output parameters\n Breaker state Load voltage Controllable source activation  Test Design The specific test makes use of the controllable MV source to emulate the blackout condition as well as the BS generation provider. Therefore, the source’s output can be deactivated manually and reactivated through a communication signal from the BS controller. In the real system, the specific signal is the start-up command from the BS controller to the BS generator. The voltages at each load should be monitored on either end of the breaker in order to verify:\n Disconnection/reconnection time If the voltage conditions for reconnection are suitable Moreover, by monitoring the frequency at the source’s output it is possible to: Verify that the controller reconnects the loads within the proper frequency conditions and in the right order Verify that the start-up command to the BS generator is communicated correctly and in the right order  Even though some voltage/frequency stability is presumed for the test, the limits for these values, especially frequency should be not considered as tight as in normal operation. Therefore, the frequency limits for this test are considered from 47.5 to 52 Hz with a ROCOF \u0026lt;2 Hz/s. The corresponding voltage limits are considered as +5% and -5% of the nominal voltage.\nInitial system state  The controllable source supplies the system with constant voltage at frequency at nominal values (fsource=50 Hz, Vsource=1 p.u.)

Nevertheless, rudimentary stability should always be maintained in order to avoid a new blackout.

Evolution of system state and test signals  At first, the system is sufficiently balanced with only a small amount of reserves (ideally zero) implemented and the voltage/frequency nominal. An imbalance emerges which leads to a significant voltage/frequency deviation and the consequent activation of a large part of reserves after a simulated communication delay. Consumption or production changes in order to reduce the variation. Subsequent disturbances emerge either before or after the restoration of voltage/frequency to its nominal value. Having started at Inp0, the voltage/frequency changes up to Val1, then down to Val2 etc. with varying step sizes (St1, St2, \u0026hellip;).

The ICT infrastructure facilitates the communication between the utility / DSO, aggregators, TSO/energy retailers, and the flexibility resources on the user end. The test focusses on the ICT\u0026rsquo;s function to carry the direct load control (DLC) signal from utilities (DSOs or aggregators) to the flexibility resource. In the adequacy investigation, the aim is to assess the impact of delays and packets losses in the control signals of flexibility activation on the quality of the supply and stability of the system. In addition, it also looks into identifying the vulnerabilities of the ICT support system towards the misuse cases. It assess how these vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker and measures the impact of these attacks on quality of supply or the stability of the system.\nSpecific Test System The test system, shown in figure below, consists a power system, ICT and Control system. The power system is a distribution network with loads/Flexibility resources such as EVs/heating loads. The ICT/control system consists a direct load controller either at the DSO or at an aggregator (optional) that sends switching signals to the flexibility resources. The aggregator avails flexibility resources to TSOs in accordance with the contractual agreement in the reserve market. Hence, depending on the frequency level and the associated power, control signals are sent to the flexibility resources by the aggregators. The ICT system consist the communication network connecting the controller at the DSO or aggregator with the TSO/ Energy retailer and the flexibility resource on the end user side.

The plant may start out in one of the networks and therefore already be known as interoperable to the initial platform prior to transfer. Otherwise, the interoperability has to be proven for both infrastructures independently. The PV plant is governed by a programmable automation control system that is scalable and fully integrated with all required data acquisition, analytical and control logic functionalities to demonstrate advanced and reliable PV system operations. The system is equipped with smart inverters and should be capable of failure diagnosis, communication with the aggregation platform (Modbus TCP), as well as storage and ancillary services compliant to the grid code. The two networks should differ in their share of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and medium voltages in order to validate the systems’ extensive interoperability.\nSpecific Test System The test system consists of the PV system and the separate (simulated) aggregation infrastructures to be qualified for interoperability. Additional generators and reactive power controllable equipment at different voltage levels are connected to each network. The test is either conducted with geographically distributed HIL or within a simulation.\nTarget measures Which values are monitored and which timeframes are acceptable depend on the system functionality under assessment. During congestion management, the PV operation should respect a reserves availability of at least 20%, as well as the direct voltage operating regions of the grid. If not linked to specific grid restrictions, there should be no significant performance variance for connection to the two distinct networks. All status reports and schedules must be communicated accurately and timely between the control systems.\nInput and output parameters Uncontrollable input parameters:\n Grid topology Generation and load profiles of other grid participants  Controllable input parameters:\n PV system controllers parameters Voltage set-point Frequency set-point Load value  Output parameters:\n Communication acknowledgements Node voltages Power losses  Test Design Testing the functionalities in their operation constitutes a practical assessment for the interoperability of the PV control system with each aggregation platform. The PV system has to fulfill ancillary services and reporting duties towards the aggregation management. It has to process and implement received activation plans. The evaluation of the system response can be done within a specific flexibility redistribution scenario. To this end, a congestion will be simulated for the connected power system. The information exchanged between the control systems during the reallocation process will be protocolled on dedicated communication channels.\nInitial system state The PV system is connected to one of the networks. The communication channels to the associated aggregation platform are set up. The initial power flow conditions are:\n The voltage/frequency value (output) matches the voltage/frequency set-point. The consumption of the loads should be at least 20% of the maximum consumption. The combination of the RES units should provide at least 20% of their nominal power.  Evolution of system state and test signals At first, the power system is sufficiently balanced, the voltage and frequency are nominal, and the PV system reserves are unengaged. Then a congestion emerges, to which the aggregation platform responds by requesting the activation of the PV reserves, alongside those of some additional RES of the network. For testing purposes, these other resources’ contribution to the congestion management is marginalized. The PV system control regulates the plant’s production and storage release to meet the grid’s demands. It incorporates subsequent updates by the platform on these demands to take further disturbances and the activity of the other RES into account, and reports on its current status and energy supply. The exchange concludes with the platform’s acknowledgement that the congestion was successfully mitigated by the increased production rate. Network properties such as voltage, frequency and load at relevant sections are monitored during the entire process to verify grid integrity at all times. Further exchanges not covered by the functionalities involved in congestion management can be tested separately and directly (e.g., scheduling or failure reporting).\nOther parameters N/A\nTemporal resolution The simulated part of the test proceeds continuously, with time step sizes depending on the software experiment:\n Time constants inside SuT in-between 50 μs and 5 s Monitoring quantities with a maximum sampling time of 0.1 sec.

The first is the efficiency of the power conversion from DC to AC, whereas the second is the accuracy of the MPPT algorithm, namely its ability to maximize the DC input power. Both aspects are assessed by measuring the power for various values of AC power and DC voltage. The scope of this test is to produce two map diagrams which illustrate the variation of the two quantities as a function of the AC power and DC voltage plus one diagram that illustrates the efficiency as a function of the AC power for three different input voltage values (minimum, medium, and maximum). All measurements throughout the test are conducted under steady-state conditions.\nSpecific Test System The setup for this test as shown above consists of the following components:\n One LV AC bi-directional source that plays the role of the AC grid One PV array which supplies with DC current the PV inverter. The PV array’s behaviour is determined by the environmental conditions. One data logger device which is used to monitor and record the power values One I-V trace module required for measuring the I-V characteristic of the array Two transducers One PV inverter which is the System (Device) under Test  Target measures  Power efficiency map as a function of output (AC) power and input (DC) voltage Power efficiency curves as a function of output (AC) power for three input (DC) voltage values MPPT accuracy map as a function of output (AC) power and input (DC) voltage  Input and output parameters Input parameters\n Solar irradiance (W/m2) Ambient temperature (oC) PV modules parameters (Voc(V), Vmp(V), Isc(A), Imp(A), CTI(A/oC), CTV(V/oC), Rs(Ω)) PV array configuration  Output parameters\n Output (AC) power (W) Input (DC) power (W) Maximum theoretical DC power (W) Input (DC) voltage (V)  Test Design The test is organized and executed in multiple steps in which the input parameters are changed in a wide range of values. The variation range must be such that the full range of AC power and DC voltage are obtained. For each set of values, the system must be stable before each measurement is conducted and recorded, except for any small oscillation/variation that is intrinsic to the inverter’s behaviour due to the MPPT algorithm that is used.\nInitial system state  The PV inverter is connected to both the AC source and the PV array The PV module parameters are selected so that the power/voltage requirements of the inverter can be met The PV array is configured in a connectivity that allows maximum DC power with minimum DC voltage (e.g., several parallel strings with a small number of modules per string). During the execution of the test this configuration is altered in order to increase the DC voltage for the same amount of power (same number of modules connected in fewer but longer strings) The PV array receives very low or zero irradiance and produces very low or zero voltage The inverter is in stand-by mode and remains as such until sufficient voltage is produced The monitoring system is initialized and running  Evolution of system state and test signals  The solar irradiance on the array slightly increases to a value that leads to activation of the PV inverter (e.g., 5% of the PAC) The system stabilizes at the new operating point The AC and DC powers, the DC voltage as well as the maximum theoretical DC power are recorded (the first three for at least 10s and averaged) The solar irradiance is increased in order to achieve the next step in the AC power (e.g., 10%) Steps 1-3 are repeated until an AC power of 110% of the nominal value is reached The PV array configuration is modified in order to allow a slightly higher DC voltage and the same procedure (steps 1-3) is repeated for an AC power range between 5 and 110% Step 6 is repeated until the maximum allowable DC voltage is reached.  The completion of the above steps signals the completion of the mapping test. One additional set of measurements, however, is necessary in order to obtain the efficiency curves for three constant voltages (min, medium, max). The steps are as follows:\n The solar irradiance on the array is slightly increased to a value that leads to activation of the PV inverter (e.g., 5% of the PAC. The ambient temperature is slightly adjusted together with the irradiance in order for the DC voltage to become and remain equal to the minimum required value The system stabilizes at the new operating point The AC and DC powers, as well as the DC voltage are recorded for at least 10s and averaged. The solar irradiance is increased in order to achieve the next step in the AC power (e.g., 10%). In parallel the temperature is adjusted in order to keep the voltage constant. Steps 9-12 are repeated until the power is 110% The PV array configuration is modified in order to allow a higher DC voltage, equal to the middle value required for the test. Steps 8-13 are repeated for an AC power range between 5 and 110% The PV array configuration is modified in order to allow a higher DC voltage, equal to the maximum value required for the test. Steps 8-13 are repeated for an AC power range between 5 and 110%  Other parameters N/A\nTemporal resolution A sampling time of \u0026lt;= 1 s for the instantaneous values is sufficient for this test to provide the necessary information since the values of all quantities are averaged within a 10-second interval\nSource of uncertainty First and foremost, the precision of the measurement equipment can be a significant source of uncertainty. The precision should be carefully selected based on the range of the quantities during the test. Other uncertainties may be introduced due to the controllability of irradiance and temperature or the stability of the MPPT algorithm under specific conditions. Last but not least, a significant source of uncertainty may be the dynamic behaviour of the PV array especially when a simulator is used. In this case the output filter of the DC converter, that is used as a PV simulator, may introduce oscillation in current and voltage resulting in erroneous operation point or measurement.\nSuspension criteria / Stopping criteria The test should be suspended and restarted if one of the quality attributes described in the TC is not met. Also, the test should be suspended are repeated if the AC voltage and frequency values are not nominal and lead to activation of the droop controllers. Lastly, stability should be ensured during each measurement.

Under normal (steady-state) conditions on the grid’s side the inverter should always maximize its power injection to the grid so that better exploitation of the solar potential is achieved. The normal operation entails that other services or functionality, that the inverter could potentially provide, such as droop control of active/reactive power or intentional power curtailment, do not act during the test. The efficiency characterization of the PV inverter in this test comes down to two main aspects of operation: on the one hand, the power/energy efficiency of the power converter and, on the other hand, the capability of the Maximum Power Point Tracker (MPPT) to detect the actual maximum power of the PV array.\nFunction(s) under Investigation (FuI)  Power conversion Maximum Power Point Tracker  Object under Investigation (OuI)  Photovoltaic Inverter  Domain under Investigation (DuI)  Electrical Environment  Purpose of Investigation (PoI)  PoI#1: Characterisation of power converter efficiency PoI#2: Characterisation of MPPT accuracy  System under Test (SuT) In this TC the System-under-Test is the PV inverter which is connected on one end to the PV array and on other to the AC distribution grid.\nFunctions under Test (FuT)  PV conversion (Current-Voltage characteristic of the PV array) Droop controllers for Active/Reactive power adjustment when the inverter is equipped with this functionality  Test criteria (TCR)  Power/energy efficiency MPPT accuracy  Target Metrics (TM)   Ratio of output versus input power:\n  Ratio of input power versus maximum theoretical PV power:\n  Variability Attributes (VA) Fully Controllable attributes:\n Solar irradiation (varies gradually from 0 to 1200 W/m2) Ambient temperature (it can vary from –20oC to +50oC) PV array asymmetrical operation (e.g., partial shading) (varies stepwise) Grid voltage and frequency (constant, e.g., 230V/50Hz) PV modules parameters PV array configuration  Quality Attributes (QA)  Sampling time of signals (Power flows): \u0026lt;=1 s Resolution: 0.1% of maximum output (AC) power Points of measurement:  One point at the AC output of the inverter One point at the DC input of the inverter   PDC,min=5% of rated power PDC,max=110% of rated power Vmin\u0026lt;VDC\u0026lt;Vmax (the minimum and maximum voltage depends on the inverter specification provided by the manufacturer)  Qualification Strategy The two PoIs of the selected TC can be addressed through two separate Test Specifications, partly in a combined way. In particular, in order to characterise the inverter’s efficiency (PoI#1) one test procedure (TS1) is required in which the SuT is tested under a wide range of irradiance variation. During this test the irradiance varies in a way that allows for the inverter to reach stability (e.g., not during fast moving clouds). For each stable operation point the input (DC) and output (AC) power values of the inverter are recorded and used for the calculation of the efficiency. Together with the converter efficiency the evaluation of the MPPT accuracy (PoI#2) can partly be obtained. The way to do this is the following: For each measuring point the maximum available power of the PV array is either calculated or measured and used in combination with the actual DC power at the inverter input in order to assess the accuracy of the MPPT algorithm. This test presumes the balanced operation of all PV modules in the array. Such operation leads to a smooth I-V characteristic which results in a P-V (power versus voltage) characteristic with one maximum point of power. However, a very interesting case can be the unbalanced operation of the PV modules which results not only in lower power but in a P-V characteristic with several maxima as well. The cause of such behaviour could be, for instance, partial shading over the PV array. As a consequence, in order to characterise the MPPT accuracy in a more holistic manner, a separate test (TS2) is required for the investigation of the inverter operation under unbalanced conditions on the PV array side.\n","excerpt":"Version management Author Evangelos Rikos\nVersion 1.0\nProject ERIGrid 2.0-NA4\nDate 09/04/2021 …","ref":"/test-case-descriptions/docs/usecases/erigrid2.0/tc05/","title":"Test Case TC05"},{"body":"Version management Author E.

The operators are responsible for providing the local market platform and take care of their possible congestions while the prosumers have the full control over their DERs. This means a different perspective over the energy management problem, traditionally centred at the distribution system operators who look for certain overall performance and benefits for the full population of DERs (e.g., by providing ancillary services upstream) instead of improving the individual benefits of the participants.\nFunction(s) under Investigation (FuI)  Bidding algorithms of the individual prosumers Clearing function of the energy trading coordinator  Object under Investigation (OuI)  Modules for creating the bids at prosumer’s level Module of the energy sharing coordinator for estimating the internal price Communication modules between a set of converters/distributed energy resources and manageable loads  Domain under Investigation (DuI)  Electrical Power ICT Market Heating/Cooling  Purpose of Investigation (PoI)  PoI1: Verification of the trading energy platform functioning to get a cost-effective operation for both the energy sharing coordinator and the prosumers (economic criteria) PoI2: Validation that the control signals derived from the decision-making process are feasible to the controllable electrical devices (technical criteria)  System under Test (SuT) Local energy community (LEC), distributed energy resources (DERs), controllers, ICT components (measuring/monitoring devices), benchmark distribution system (optional).\nFunctions under Test (FuT)  Capability of communication among different OuI.

The level of voltage fluctuation depends on grid topology, different operating conditions as well as level of RES penetration. Therefore, voltage control in distribution grids has become an essential task.\nIndeed, effective voltage control strategies have a number of benefits:\n Reduce voltage fluctuation Improve quality of power supply Maximize the penetration of PV into the grid Participate in ancillary services Increase the flexibility of operation Reduce PV curtailment There are a variety of voltage control strategies for distribution grids such as centralized, decentralized, or distributed. This Test Case is proposed to evaluate the distributed voltage control for distribution grids with high integration of single- and three-phase PV systems under different operating conditions.  Function(s) under Investigation (FuI)  MAS-based distributed voltage-var control Reactive power capability of PV systems and their reactive power control modes for voltage control support  The amount of reactive power absorbed/injected by the PV systems can be controlled following the characteristic below (ENTSO EN 50438:2013 or ENTSO EN 50549-1:2019 “Requirements for micro-generating plants to be connected in parallel with public low-voltage distribution networks”):\nIn addition, the reactive power exchange capability of the PV systems must meet these requirements:\n follow a characteristic curve provided by the DSO (see 4.4) within the active factor cos ϕ = 0,90-under-excited to 0,90-over-excited when the active power output of the PV plants is more than or equal to 20 % of its nominal active power; not exchanging more reactive power than 10 % of the PV plant’s nominal active power when the active power output is less than 20 % of its nominal active power.

As a result, the distribution network operators (DSOs) need to focus on the challenge of balancing power supply and demand. Congestion in the distribution network refers to an overvoltage at the connection points as well as overloading of the network components.\nOn the one hand, to mitigate the network strains, conventionally DSOs focus mainly on network development by installing new cables and transformers to meet the increasing power flows. Nonetheless, the distribution loads are spread over large geographically areas and in a distributed manner, making the upgrade of the network more financially infeasible in a short term. Another alternative solution is to develop grid congestion management approaches so that the network infrastructure can be utilized in a better way. There are two types of congestion management methods namely direct as well as indirect. The former technique is realized by performing load curtailment, local generation reduction, network re-configuration, new installation of Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). In contrast, the latter approach focuses on solving the optimization of electricity cost with the constraints ensuring the transformers/feeders not to be overloaded.\nThe direct congestion management method in this test includes two stages. The first stage consists of using a machine learning method, such as support vector machine, multi-class classification, decision tree, ANN\u0026hellip;, in order to build congestion classification models. Once congestion is detected, it has to be labeled to one of the following statuses: normal, alert, emergency, and critical depending on the output of the trained models. In the second step, DSOs will use the congestion labeling to calculate the expected flexibility portfolio. With the expected procurement cost, the flexibility available in the feeders/households can be used to solve the congestion problem. After comparing the results with different conditions, the best setting for the congestion management can be chosen.\nOn the other hand, an indirect congestion management needs to be based on an online learning technique to emulate the demand flexibility of a network. As for emulating the demand flexibility, the concept of price elasticity of demand can be considered. Accordingly, demand flexibility during all time-periods of a day shall be treated as a commodity that can be substituted or complemented to each other.\nThe objective of this Test Case is to evaluate different congestion management methods in distribution grid under the circumstance of high penetration of DERs and other active loads such as EVs, HPs \u0026hellip;\nFunction(s) under Investigation (FuI) Congestion management of the DMS controller\n Direct approach: mitigating congestions by curtailment of load and local generation and by influencing the voltage level at the secondary side of a MV/LV transformer Indirect approach: motivating individual prosumers with dynamic prices through intermediate market entities such as aggregators and retailers. DSOs also incentivize customers by providing compensations for their load reduction when needed to solve network congestions.

This test ensures that the combination of the protection relay and the static switch can adequately disconnect the microgrid when frequency disturbances appear. This test examines the response of the protection subsystem for various kinds of disturbances including over/underfrequency and increased ROCOF. -The second test is related to the protection subsystem and its ability to detect voltage disturbances. The reason why this functionality is addressed separately than the frequency test is the different requirements in the test system topology. In the voltage test, specifically, the detailed microgrid topology is considered since it can affect the voltage level at the Point of Common Coupling. -The third test is related to the response of the grid-supporting voltage source inverters of the microgrid after the disconnection. In principle, the test aims to assess the capability of these resources to maintain a voltage/frequency deviation within specific limits thanks to the primary control. The test is conducted under different initial conditions depending on the event that activates the protection equipment (for example, over/underfrequency).\n","excerpt":"Version management Author E.

Indicators for the achieved interoperability are the ease of transfer of a DER from one Virtual Power Plant (VPP) to another, the coordinated control and monitoring of the resources, and the potential for service matching among the providers.

The characterization of this performance is one of the major goals of this test case, taking into account the different communication technologies that could be supported in such devices (e.g. communication protocols) and the stochastic nature of communication effects. In particular, the experiments in the test case allow characterizing the performance of communication equipment by means of communication delay calculation and the rate of dropped packets between two RTUs. Through this experiment, it is possible to determine the mean value and the standard deviation of the communication delay between two devices, together with the packet loss rate for different polling times.\nFunction(s) under Investigation (FuI) The characteristics of two communication devices exchanging information.

Capability of Communication protocol translation by OuI. One communication emulator, such as ATTERO Ethernet connection cables (RJ45)  Test criteria (TCR)  The real time simulator needs to send a data profile periodically using a certain pre-defined communication protocol. Due to the stochastic nature of communication phenomena, the data profile needs to be sent periodically enough times to be able to obtain statistically valid results. The real time simulator needs to register the time for which data is sent and for which data is received, in order to calculate the communication delay of each data value.  Target Metrics (TM) Data profile:\n The data profile needs to be arranged in a way that it is possible to determine the communication roundtrip time (delay) of each data value. A series of increasing integer values is proposed with an increasing value change periodicity. For example:  In the previous figure, the constant α represents the reduction of the time during a particular value is sent. It is noted that the polling time of the devices must be less than the time duration of a sent value.\n  The delay and the lost packages have to be registered:\n  The delay for each successfully transmitted data value can be used to create a normal distribution of the delay probability (obtaining the mean delay value and its standard deviation):\n  The successful transmission rate can be calculated for each value sent from the profile, allowing to determine the minimum periodicity that can be 100% successfully transmitted\n  Variability Attributes (VA)  Periodicity for which a data value changes.

The methodology is used mainly as a common framework for interoperability testing and consist of five stages; Use Case creation (UC), Basic Application Profile (BAP) creation, Basic Application Interoperability profile (BAIOP) creation, Design of Experiments (DoE), Testing and Analysis of Experiments (AE). Each stage allows the developer to select certain features then used in the subsequent stage. During the completion of all stages, the developer can select relevant standards, their options, test beds with all qualified and test equipment as well their attributes or functions used during the testing. The proposed methodology summarizes a set of best practices the developer could follow to complete in a smooth way a smart grid interoperability test.\nFig.1 A schematic overview of the JRC Interoperability testing methodology\nIn this test case, we will investigate through the interoperability validation tests, the interaction and information exchange between the involved actors for a flexibility activation event. This event will be triggered by a local node voltage disturbance and followed by a consequent flexibility request. To this end, we will analyze voltage restoration level, time and control.\nFunction(s) under Investigation (FuI) Voltage restore, activation and restoration time for interoperability profiles (BAIOP), validate the interfaces between the actors involved in the flexibility activation chain, impact to the grid.\nIn this use case, we will analyze the performance of the “voltage restoration” function, after a voltage disturbance occurs in the power grid when different system variables (input factors) are considered and changed. The performance of this function is assessed an interoperability point of view, where different system variables (input factors) potentially affecting the system performance are considered and their effect on the system response is analysed. A reference grid model will be used (JRA1.1?).\nObject under Investigation (OuI) The actual components and equipment under testing, e.g. communication infrastructure categorized by its technology (cable, Fiber, local Etherent, xDSL, etc.), controllers (e.g., RTU and Flexibility run in single-boards computers like Raspberry Pi), etc.\nDomain under Investigation (DuI)  Communication/ICT/Control Electrical Power System  Purpose of Investigation (PoI) Pol#1: Evaluate the interoperability between the involved actors and the different components in the system (flexibility provider, requester, other intermediates). Validate the interfaces along with specific communication technologies. Pol#2: Assess the restoration time and the level of the restored voltage among the different interface profiles\nSystem under Test (SuT)  Lower bound communication architecture: from the DSO to the Device through a Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) à two communication links: DSO ↔ RTU and RTU ↔ Device Distribution system (lines, transformers, etc.): power distribution network (MV/LV) / LV distribution feeder  Functions under Test (FuT) In-focus functions: Voltage restore (including restoration time), interoperability testing validation of the selected interfaces, real time simulator for the LV distribution benchmark network Emulated functions: ICT network emulator- communication network emulation, Controlling functions of the systems (e.g., DSO ↔ RTU and RTU ↔ Device) Actuation functions: Flexibility signal (demand response) to manage voltage disturbance event in a system node Observer functions: SCADA monitoring system to detect voltage deviations and instruct the RTU for the activation of the selected flexibility source available in the system\nTest criteria (TCR)  Safe and robust voltage for all nodes Restore (in real time) of voltage to acceptable levels (0.95 pu \u0026lt; voltage \u0026lt; 1.05 pu) for the node the disturbance takes place Restoration time for voltage testing the communication interfaces Effectiveness of flexibility service activation patterns Communication functionality, configuration and interoperability validation for all the tested interfaces  Target Metrics (TM)  The value of the voltage measured at node 𝑖 after the flexibility (located at the same node) is activated in the attempt of restoring the voltage within the allowed DSO-specific voltage range The time the system took in order to restore the voltage at node 𝑖  Variability Attributes (VA) The admitted voltage deviation, which is the maximum allowed value from which the node voltage, in percentage, can deviate with respect to the reference voltage. This parameter is meant to be a DSO-oriented factor, and the influence of its variability on the system outputs (together with that of the other considered input factors) is studied.\nQuality Attributes (QA)  Power quality standard EN50160 All node voltages within the specified limit (+ or -10%) System restoration time  Qualification Strategy Both PoI#1 and PoI#2 are met with Test Specification 24.01. The overall interoperability evaluation for the test will be in the form of a final “pass/fail” form. For PoI#2, the time that the system needs to activate the voltage support mechanism and successfully restore the voltage to acceptable levels will be evaluated. It should be also mentioned that although both PoI can be met by TS 24.01, multiple interfaces (each one corresponding to a different BAIOP) depending on the selected telecommunication technology will be tested for the two communication links under consideration (DSO ↔ RTU and RTU ↔ Device). These will result in multiple experiment specifications.\n","excerpt":"Version management Author Dimitrios Thomas, Petra Raussi, Vetrivel S.

This is seen as the most cost-effective path in developing smart grids. An essential part of any functional power system are substations; thus, their digitalization is crucial. While the digitalization of power system brings several benefits from cost savings to more optimized operations and investments, it also raises concerns related to cybersecurity. To ensure safe and resilient operation of digital substations even in the case of cyber attacks or incidents, it is necessary to investigate their cyber resilience. This can aid in impact analysis of cyber attacks on digital substations, and help to gain deeper understanding of which components must be most secured\nFunction(s) under Investigation (FuI)  Grid stability and operation when impacted by cyber-attacks/incidents Cyber resilience of digital substations  Object under Investigation (OuI) Digital substation components and communication systems:\n substation bays (busbars, disconnectors, circuit breakers, current and voltage transformers), merging units, Ethernet switches, HMIs, time servers, IEDs, centralized protection and control units, station control systems, process bus, and communication gateways.

Hence, to realize this test case, the following components are required:\n Real-time grid simulator such as RTDS or OPAL-RT that supports Hardware-in-Loop (HIL) studies Substation network elements: 1. At least one ethernet switch and time server. At least two or more physical IEC 61850 capable IEDs 1. RTUs, MUs, other HIL devices A dedicated communication network emulator to model disturbances/cyber attacks The testing involves interfacing the real-time grid simulator with all hardware components in a HIL setup to mimic a digital substation. Furthermore, the real-time grid simulator also needs to be interfaced with the network emulator to model and input communication related effects such as latency, packet loss, loss of service, etc.  Source: Centralized Protection and Control.

This experiment seeks to analyse the impact of a DoS attack that successfully compromises the substation communication infrastructure.

The test consists of a reference test for the baseline measurements and repeat of this test with the DoS attack. The test design is as follows:\n Start the system with all devices functioning as required and the system is stabilized. Run a test simulation with a short-circuit or fault condition at location monitored by relay. Note that the appropriate relay communicates trip signal via IEC 61850 GOOSE message. Note this time as reference time T1. Circuit breaker is opened, and the fault is cleared. Carry out DoS attack via external emulator/device to target specific IED/relay. Repeat steps 2 to 3 and note the new time T2. Quantify impact of attack through KPIs and note down targeted device.

This is needed to sufficiently evaluate the capability of the frequency control system to cope with these incidents. It is possible that the initial state of the microgrid grid-connected with the exchange of power with the utility grid. At the beginning of the test the circuit breaker can be opened to isolate the microgrid and cause a disturbance in the power balance.\nInitial system state  The circuit breaker at the PCC is open. Alternatively, it can be opened right after the start of the test as a potential disturbance source. The combination of the RES units should provide at least 20% of their nominal power. The consumption of the loads should be at least 20% of the maximum consumption. The battery SOC should be between 40 and 60% The imbalance should be under 5%.  Evolution of system state and test signals  The microgrid starts in islanded mode or in grid-connected mode. Firstly, the system is sufficiently balanced so that a small number of reserves (ideally zero) are implemented and the frequency is nominal (50Hz). One imbalance emerges which leads to significant frequency deviation and the consequent activation of a large part of reserves. Subsequent disturbances emerge either before or after the restoration of frequency to its nominal value.

Also, suspension may be due to deviation from the desired initial conditions described above.\nMapping to Research Infrastructure Our final goal of the mapping step is to produce as many as possible among a number of different testing approaches.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope A local energy community - With the new Clean Energy Package, private households are encouraged not only to generate and consume energy, to market the flexibility of controllable producers and consumers in the future, but also to make energy available to each other and to share generated energy. In the future energy distribution network, the new regulatory framework, technical developments and grid fee mechanisms canmotivate households to found and/or join energy communities with the aim to maximize the consumption of locally generated energy. Communities with a high penetration of photovoltaic systems and correspondingly large installed generation capacity can be expected to generate an energy surplus during times of peak generation and low local demand, and vice versa to run into an energy deficit during seasons of low generation. Surplus energy can be stored and shifted to times of low generation in order to satisfy temporary demand and hence increase the degree of self-sufficiency up to 100%.  Networks: LV  Markets: None   Objective(s) -\tMaximize consumption of local generation/Minimize demand satisfied by public grid  -\tIslanding of local grid by making use of flexible loads and storages  -\tMaximizing duration of islanding operation -\tUC 1 is prerequisite for UC 2 to 4   Related business case(s) no    1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThe use case “Islanding” of an energy community aims to balance generation and demand of a local energy community in such a way that the load flow across the connecting MV/LV transformer is reduced to a minimum. The balancing is enabled by an energy management systems called Avacon Local Flex Controller (ALF-C). The ALF-C monitors the power flow across the transformer and controls a battery energy storage system (BESS) connected directly to the LV-terminal of the substation. Generated energy surplus will be stored in the BESS and released at times of a generation deficit. Private households equipped with batteries and controllable electric heaters can be dispatched to increase the degree of self-sufficiency further.\nComplete description\nThe Clean Energy for all Europeans Package, encourages private households are not only to generate and consume energy, to market the flexibility of controllable producers and consumers in the future, but also to make energy available to each other and to share self-generated energy. In the future energy distribution network, the new regulatory framework, technical development and grid fee mechanisms can motivate households to found and/or join energy communities with the aim to maximize the consumption of locally generated energy. This will lead to a change in the behaviors of electrical energy exchange along the grid connection point of the MV/LV grid and consequently load flows along the MV-lines. A local Energy Management System (EMS) named (Avacon Local Flex Controller –( ALF-C) will monitor local generation, demand and storage capacities and control available flexibilities in such a way that consumption of locally generated energy will be maximized. When local generation exceeds local demand, surplus energy will automatically be stored in local storages and the consumption of available flexible loads will be increased. When local consumption is exceeding local generation, stored electrical energy in local batteries will be discharged. The target is to minimize the load flow exchange at the MV/LV grid connection to a level at which the community is virtually islanded. In cases where generation and demand can not be balanced due to a lack of available storage capacity or flexibility, the residual load will exported/imported. A sensor located at the grid connection will measure the power exchange of all 3 phases between the medium voltage and low voltage grid. The measured values indicate the residual demand or export of surplus of generated energy/power. Data is provided to the EMS an based on the information increases or decreases the load in order balance the grid. Additionally, customer households provide flexible load and storage capacities for steering. Flexible assets in the field are equipped with sensors and controllers for steering to increase or decrease demand and to command charging or discharging of local large Battery Energy Storage System and private customer household storages. Vendors of flexible assets provide a cloud data management platform from which measurement data are accessible for EMS via an backend. The interface also provides data to sensors located in private customer households will provide measurements of energy consumption and provide the necessary data for EMS to estimate the state of charge of batteries or flexible loads and potential available storage capacity. With Hhistorical measurement data and weather forecasts provided by external service providers enable the EMS to predict energy generation and consumption to maximize self-sufficiency. Controllers Actuators enable EMSC to switch on and off, increase or decrease energy consumption of individual loads, such as storage heaters and heat pumps, and storages located in private households and the large scale storage located in the community.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope Communities with a high penetration of photovoltaic systems and correspondingly high installed generation capacity can be expected to generate an energy surplus during times of peak generation and low local demand, and vice versa to run into an energy deficit during seasons of low generation. Surplus energy can be stored and shifted to times of low generation in order to satisfy temporary demand and hence increase the degree of self-sufficiency. Use Case 2 demonstrates how the flexibility required to enable a local balancing mechanism could temporarily be allocated to other uses, for example the provision of flexibility to a third party, e.g. the connecting grid operator. Use Case 2 uses the available flexibility in a given local energy community to maintain an externally defined non-zero setpoint at the point of connection.  Networks: LV  Markets: None   Objective(s) Maintain a fixed non-zero power exchange between energy community and the distribution network for a limited duration.   Related business case(s) Integration of local energy communities in network management strategies for the stabilization and uniform utilization in distribution grid    1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nLocal energy communities are likely to emerge in Europe in the near future but will most likely retain an interconnection to the distribution grid. These communities will require a large share of flexibility to enable their primary use case. Situations could arise that require the community to provide flexibility to third parties – driven by technical circumstances or following economic considerations (market incentives). Use Case 2 demonstrates the ability and practical feasibility of a local community to maintain constant non-zero power exchange with the distribution network for a previously defined duration.\nComplete description\nThe community is consuming and/or generating energy. A user (in the case of the field trial the DSO) triggers the EMS to apply Use Case 2 and sets a target value (P’Breaker) for the power exchange at the grid connection. The EMS (ALF-C) processes weather forecasts and measurement values from the grid connection and flexible assets such as BESS, household energy storages and flexible loads located in the community. Based on the data and historic values the EMS forecasts the local generation and demands and determines the best strategy to reach (P’Breaker) by utilizing the available flexibility to keep the power flow constant for a pre-defined duration.  The EMS communicates with sensors through the Blockchain Access Platform and DSO Technical Platform and handles all data in a dedicated data base. The DSO Technical Platform provides encryption and decryption in the whole IT infrastructure. Control signals are routed through the DSO technical platform and the Blockchain Access Platform to flexible devices, if applicable through a third-party backend that connects to the hardware.\n1.5.

These communities are unlikely to meet their own needs with locally generated energy throughout the year and will potentially run into energy-deficit in times of low local generation. Energy deficits could be compensated by the supplying distribution network.

Narrative of Use Case Short description\nLocal energy communities (LEC, CEC) are likely to emerge in Europe in the near future but will most likely retain an interconnection to the distribution grid. These communities will require a large share of flexibility to enable their primary use case (islanding).  In the absence of sufficient generation and storage, the community is unlikely to be self-sufficient at all times. When energy deficits occur, they must be provided by the distribution network. Instead of a real time energy supply by the connected distribution network, energy deficits could be forecast and supplied as an energy package with a defined time, duration and power value for the load exchange at the LV/ MV-grid connection point that connects the community with the distribution grid. The energy package shall be stored in local storages within the community and available for use, when the demand is rising. Outside of the defined periods of energy provision, no power exchange shall all the grid connection point shall take place, according to DE-UC1. This use case enables the DSO to reduce overall network costs, for example by gaining the ability to stagger the demand of multiple communities along a single feeder, thusly reducing the factor of coincidence of peak load and peak load level accordingly.\nComplete description\nadd text - longer narrative from user viewpoint about what happens how, where, when, why and under which assumptions.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope Communities with a high penetration of photovoltaic systems and correspondingly high installed generation capacity can be expected to generate an energy surplus during times of peak generation and low local demand, and vice versa to run into an energy deficit during seasons of low generation. Surplus energy can be stored and shifted to times of low generation in order to satisfy temporary demand and hence increase the degree of self-sufficiency. Use Case 2 demonstrates how the flexibility required to enable a local balancing mechanism could temporarily be allocated to other uses, for example the provision of flexibility to a third party, e.g. the connecting grid operator. Use Case 2 uses the available flexibility in a given local energy community to maintain an externally defined non-zero setpoint at the point of connection.

In the absence of sufficient generation and storage, the community is unlikely to be self-sufficient at all times.

Instead of a real time energy export to the connected distribution network, energy surplus could be forecast and exported delayed as an energy package within a defined time, duration and power value for the load exchange at the LV/ MV-grid connection point. The generated energy surplus first shall be stored in local storages located within the community and be exported as an energy package delayed, when the load in the upper grid decreases. Outside of the defined periods of energy export, no power exchange shall take place, according to DE-UC1.

The schedule can be defined for a duration for the next 1 to 24 hours.  The schedule contains time slots for the export of energy in which P’Breaker ≠ 0 and time slots in which no power shall be exchange along the grid connection point (P’Breaker = 0), following the principle of UC 1. During the application of UC 4 the total amount of exported energy shall meet the total amount of the residual energy surplus that the community will generate. The generated surplus will therefore have to be forecasted by the user. In times P’Breaker = 0 the generated surplus will have to be stored in local battery energy storages systems. In times P’Breaker ≠ 0, local batteries will be triggered to discharge in order to export generated surplus from LV into MV grid. To maintain the given setpoint P’Breaker deficits shall be covered by energy provided by batteries located in the local network whereas generated surplus shall be buffered in available batteries.  After the user input has been confirmed the EMS begins with the application of UC 4. The EMS receives weather forecasts provided by an external service provider and measurement values provided by sensors located at the LV/MV grid connection point, flexible assets such as BESS, household energy storages and flexible loads as well as household grid connection points. Based on the received data and historic measurements values the EMS forecasts the local generation and demands and determines the best strategy to reach and maintain the setpoint schedule by utilizing the available flexibility for the pre-defined duration.  A sensor located at the grid connection will measure the power exchange of all 3 phases with the MV grid PBreaker and provide data to the EMS. Based on the information the EMS determines deviations between PBreaker and P’Breaker and dispatches setpoints to increases or decreases the load in the grid in order to reach P’Breaker. Additionally, sensors located in private customer households will provide measurements of energy consumption and SOC/SOE of storages and provide data to the EMS. With historical measurement data and weather forecast provided by external service providers enable the EMS to predict energy generation and consumption to maximize the duration of time of maintaining P’Breaker.  In cases generation and demand cannot be balanced to reach (P’Breaker) due to a lack of available storage capacity or flexibility, the use case will be terminated.\n1.5.

Narrative of Use Case Short description The UC investigates the capability of the state estimation tool to filter the available measurement data, comprising actual measurements obtained from active metering devices and pseudo-measurements, i.e. data derived from load forecasting or RES scheduling for network observability accomplishment, in order to identify measurements with gross errors (bad data), to suppress measurement errors, to reconcile inconsistent data and, ultimately, to estimate the actual operational network state.\nComplete description The DSO operates the distribution network. A measurement set, composed of actual and historical measurement data obtained from the dispersed metering devices (AMR, GIS, SCADA) installed throughout the network, is available for real-time operation purposes. The related measurements refer to power flows and voltage magnitudes at the top of distribution feeders, power injections from distributed generation units, and load pseudo-measurements for aggregated consumer demand at MV/LV transformer level. Given that the network model (topology) is known with a good degree of certainty, the state estimation tool ensures that the network is observable based on the available measurement set and, subsequently, calculates the estimated state vector, that is, the voltage magnitudes and angles of all network buses.\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope The scope of the UC is the integration of measurement data obtained from PMUs into the State Estimation tool.   Objective(s) * To reinforce network observability and controllability via improved state estimation performance. * To ensure smooth incorporation of synchronised measurement data derived from PMUs into the preexisting system of conventional measurements.   Related business case(s) add text    Notes:\n Scope - describes the aims and boundaries of the use case in a short, precise text. Objective(s) - goals of the use case, in form of bullet points and a short headline. Realted business case(s) - optional  1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description Measurement data obtained from the installed PMUs are integraded in the State Estimation tool and used to enhance the network observability. The installation of PMUs at selected buses is sure to upgrade the overall metering infrastructure of the network, since they record synchronized measurements of bus voltage phasors as well as a number of line current phasors—all of which are independent of each other and count as individual measurements. Yet, their proper utilization via the SE tool is a challenging task due to a) the intense discrepancies in update rates between conventional and PMU measurements, b) the provision of current measurements which often lead to various numerical problems, and c) the contrast between the large weighting factors linked to PMU measurements compared to the much lower ones linked to pseudo-measurements, which usually raises ill-conditioning issues. The goal is to ensure that the integration of PMU data will be smooth and all the aforesaid problems will be circumvented.\nComplete description A measurement set, composed of actual and historical measurement data obtained from the dispersed metering devices (AMR, GIS, SCADA, PMUs) installed throughout the network, is available to the DSO for real-time operation purposes. The aforementioned data refer to a) synchronised measurements of bus voltage phasors and line current phasors (magnitude and angle) and b) conventional measurements of power flows and voltage magnitudes at the top of distribution feeders, power injections from distributed generation units, and load pseudo-measurements for aggregated consumer demand at MV/LV transformer level. Given that the network model (topology) is known with a good degree of certainty, the state estimation tool ensures that the network is observable based on the available measurement set, reconciles the PMU data with the conventional measurements, and, subsequently, calculates the estimated state vector, that is, the voltage magnitudes and angles of all network buses.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope The scope of the UC is to examine the operational use of flexibility tools in order to satisfy EN50160 in case of a voltage level limit violation in the distribution network and mitigate line congestion, especially in MV lines with flexible loads availability.   Objective(s) *To use network tariffs in order to incentivise a more efficient operation of the network while respecting operation limits (voltages, lines)    Related business case(s) add text    Notes:\n Scope - describes the aims and boundaries of the use case in a short, precise text. Objective(s) - goals of the use case, in form of bullet points and a short headline. Realted business case(s) - optional  1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description Various types of flexible loads -aggregated for the scope of the Use Case- react to network tariffs sent by the DSO, so that a voltage/line thermal limit violation is mitigated.The DSO will examine the operation of tools and services for decision making support to mitigate voltage/thermal line limits violations, assuming that the grid state estimation has a good degree of certainty .\nComplete description Customers with flexible loads are connected to the distribution network and their loads are considered aggregated for the scope of the UCs regarding their management in the MV level. State of the network is known with a good degree of certainty based on the state vector that the state estimation tool produces using the available measurements and the topology data from the AMR, GIS, SCADA and PMUs. The DSO communicates network tariffs in a day-ahead context. These tariffs appropriately reflect the potential of the network exceeding its physical limits resulting in violations and/or curtailment of demand/generation. Compared to the business as usual scenario of the flat network tariffs, the DSO aims at reducing such negative effects by the use of variable day-ahead network tariffs, which incentivise the appropriate actions of the -assumed as- rational users of the distribution network.\nadd text - longer narrative from user viewpoint about what happens how, where, when, why and under which assumptions.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case Scope and objectives of use case\n         Scope The scope of the UC is to examine the integration and operational use of low cost PMUs in order to increase network observability collecting measurement data such as voltage, current and phases in various points of the distribution network. More in detail, the DSO will use the data collected to improve the operation of the tools and services developed within the project by exploiting increased data granularity. Furthermore, the data coming from various sources and systems of the DSO should be integrated in the DSO Technical Platform having first passed through the Blockchain Access Platform developed in the project to provide data access security and data integrity. In addition, all the available data should be further delivered for use by tools and services developed in order to support flexibility mechanisms. All the appropriate communication protocols should be integrated and tested to develop a unique point of data delivery to various actors involved in the project and a User Interface (UI) should be developed to allow the DSO personnel to use the available tools and services.   Objective(s) * To increase network observability.  * To integrate data coming from different sources in the DSO Technical Platform.

Narrative of Use Case Short description PMUs are installed in critical network nodes to increase network observability. PMU measurements along with other DSO data (network topology, customer loads, etc) are integrated in the DSO Technical Platform to be visulalised in a User Interface (UI), so that DSO can make use of tools and services developed in the project. Aforementioned data is going through the Blockchain Access Platform developed in the project to ensure data access security and data integrity.\nComplete description\nThe DSO operates the distribution network and handles the data sources coming from various systems such as SCADA/DMS, AMR, GIS etc. Data coming from various sources get integrated into the Open DSO Technical Platform providing an adequate level of network observability. Low cost PMUs are deployed in Mesogia area in critical network points and nodes where there is limited observability or a requirement to have an increased awareness such as DER and prosumers bidirectional power flows. Also, PMU data are integrated in the DSO Technical Platform following a data collection plan that serves the functionalities of the flexibility tools and services. Measurements from PMUs enhance network awareness in terms of data granularity and number of nodes observed in a cost effective manner. Also, the open DSO Technical Platform performs the correlation of the data coming from different sources and systems during real time, providing to the DSO the technical capacity for flexibility mechanisms support and a User Interface (UI) where the aforementioned is visualised. All data is verified and secured by the use of blockchain technology to be developed in the Blockhain Access Platform of the project.\n1.5.

Scope and Objectives of Use Case          Scope Avoiding the voltage violations in distribution and transmission grid, using the flexibility resources connected to the distribution systems which provide flexibility services through a market mechanism.  Networks: MV, LV  Markets: Day Ahead, Real Time   Objective(s) * To support the TSO to use the flexibility provided by the resources connected to the distribution system for voltage violation, respecting the distribution system constraints  * To ensure an inclusive and non-discriminatory access to the market to all the actors that provide grid services  * To empower coordination between system operators  * To activate flexibility to solve voltage violations in the distribution grid    Related business case(s) add text    1.4. Narrative of Use Case Short description\nThis use case describes the main steps to avoid voltage violations in transmission and distribution systems by exploiting flexibility resources, contemplating all the phases concerned (procurement, activation and settlement) in the day-ahead and real time flexibility market. The DSO can use flexible resources connected to the distribution system and the TSO can use flexible resources connected to distribution systems under the DSO’s approval. The state estimation is assessed and monitored by the DSO in order to keep the electrical quantities within admissible ranges.\nComplete description\nThe Use Case describes the main steps to avoid voltage violations in transmission and distribution systems by exploiting flexibility resources, contemplating all the phases concerned (procurement, activation and settlement) in the day-ahead and real time flexibility market. The DSO can use flexible resources connected to the distribution system and the TSO can use flexible resources connected to distribution systems under the DSO’s approval. The state estimation is assessed and monitored by the DSO in order to keep the electrical quantities within admissible ranges.\nIn the day ahead market, the FR Owner sends to Aggregator Platform the list of the resources available for the day after. The list is subsequently transmitted by the Aggregator Platform to the Shared Customer Database (SCD). For each Point of delivery (PODs), the SCD collects quarterly measures and data useful for flexibility and sends them to the DSO Technical Platform, the TSO simulator and the Aggregator Platform.\nOther three processes take place parallelly:\n Detection of voltage violations on the distribution grid by the DSO Technical Platform and definition of local flexibility requests, in the event the issue cannot be solved through its own solutions; Definition of voltage violations on the transmission network by the TSO simulator and request of flexibility to solve them in HV grid; Gathering by the Aggregator Platform of flexibility offers from customers in LV and MV and offering to the Market.  At gate closure, all day ahead requests and offers are stored in the Market Platform, which matches first the offers with the DSO’s requests, and orders them economically; then, it repeats the same procedure with the TSO requests.\nThe list of awarded offers is sent to DSO TP for evaluating the grid constraints violations. Finally, the market platform receives the list of offers compliant with local grid constraints and sends it to all the stakeholders. At this step, the Aggregator Platform sends a reservation to the FR Owner for the resources that will be selected for the day-ahead market.\nThe same steps are also followed in the Real Time sessions. Indeed, in these Market sessions, the offers to be matched with DSO and TSO Real Time requests are the ones still valid because not matched in previous market sessions.\nThe activation phase begins when the DSO and TSO need flexibility. The DSO TP and the TSO simulator communicate to the market Platform to move a specific offer. The Market Platform sends the order to the DSO TP, that divides it for every POD and dispatches the set point to the light nodes. The light nodes make available the set points to the BMS and measures the electrical quantities to be sent to the SCD for evaluate the energy flexibility. For the settlement phase, the Market Platform acquires data from the SCD and calculates the difference between market baseline, evaluated by BRP, and electrical quantities measured in the same time frame, uploaded in the SCD by Light Nodes. The Market Platform runs the settlement algorithm and finds the outcomes. Settlement outcomes are transmitted to the Aggregator Platform, the DSO and the TSO Simulator.\nFinally, the DSO pays the flexibility to the aggregator, that can pay the fee to the FR Owner.\n1.5.

The DSO can use flexible resources connected to the distribution system and the TSO can use flexible resources connected to distribution systems under the DSO’s approval. The state estimation is assessed and monitored by the DSO in order to keep the electrical quantities within admissible ranges In the day ahead market, the FR Owner sends to Aggregator Platform the list of the resources available for the day after. The list is subsequently transmitted by the Aggregator Platform to the Shared Customer Database (SCD). For each Point of delivery (PODs), the SCD collects quarterly measures and data useful for flexibility and sends them to the DSO Technical Platform, the TSO simulator and the Aggregator Platform.\nOther three processes take place parallelly:\n  Detection of congestion issues on the distribution grid by the DSO Technical Platform and definition of local flexibility requests, in the event the issue cannot be solved through its own solutions;\n  Definition of congestion issues on the transmission network by the TSO simulator and request of flexibility to solve them in HV grid;\n  Gathering by the Aggregator Platform of flexibility offers from customers in LV and MV and offering to the Market.\n  At gate closure, all day ahead requests and offers are stored in the Market Platform, which matches first the offers with the DSO’s requests, and orders them economically; then, it repeats the same procedure with the TSO requests.\nThe list of awarded offers is sent to DSO TP for evaluating the grid constraints violations. Finally, the market platform receives the list of offers compliant with local grid constraints and sends it to all the stakeholders.\nAt this step, the Aggregator Platform sends a reservation to the FR Owner for the resources that will be selected for the day-ahead market. The same steps are also followed in the Real Time sessions. Indeed, in these Market sessions, the offers to be matched with DSO and TSO Real Time requests are the ones still valid because not matched in previous market sessions.\nThe activation phase begins when the DSO and TSO need flexibility. The DSO TP and the TSO simulator communicate to the market Platform to move a specific offer. The Market Platform sends the order to the DSO TP, that divides it for every POD and dispatches the set point to the light nodes. The light nodes make available the set points to the BMS and measures the electrical quantities to be sent to the SCD for evaluate the energy flexibility.\nFor the settlement phase, the Market Platform acquires data from the SCD and calculates the difference between market baseline, evaluated by BRP, and electrical quantities measured in the same time frame, uploaded in the SCD by Light Nodes. The Market Platform runs the settlement algorithm and finds the outcomes. Settlement outcomes are transmitted to the Aggregator Platform, the DSO and the TSO Simulator.\nFinally, the DSO pays the flexibility to the aggregator, that can pay the fee to the FR Owner.\n1.5.
